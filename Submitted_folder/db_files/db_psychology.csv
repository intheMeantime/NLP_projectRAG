"STS 007 Class Notes
Industrial Revolution
What do they know already? (Alex esp.)
Concept of revolutions in history (already mentioned re Neolithic)
A reminder: it’s a metaphor – that which revolves, notably the heavenly bodies in orbit
Yet: great prototype of the French Revolution, overturning of one regime for another
Naming by Blanqui, also Engels, also Arnold Toynbee’s book by this name (economic history,
1884; productivity not industry per se)
See Christian, tables 407-9
Something big happened: it is not just “industrial” –
Eric Hobsbawm, The Age of Revolution (many; the long revolution), 1962
“What does the phrase `the IR broke out’ mean? It means that some time in the 1780s, and for
the first time in human history, the shackles were taken off the productive power of human
societies, which henceforth became capable of the constant, rapid and up to the present limitless
multiplication of men, goods and services. This is now technically known to the economists as
the `take-off into self-sustained growth.” No previous society had been able to break through the
[Malthusian] ceiling which a pre-industrial social structure, defective S&T, and consequently
periodic breakdown, famine and death, imposed on production.” (28)
…By any reckoning this was probably the most important event in world history, at any rate
since the invention of agriculture and cities. And it was initiated by Britain. That this was not
fortuitous, is evident.” (29)
Let’s go back to Christian here on the IR compare with Neolithic (Christian 410) -
comprehensive:
Christian wraps them up in Modern Revolution: political, cultural too
Interplay of politics and industry – why workers’ rebellions were dealt with so harshly EP
Thompson on The Making of the English Working Class
Role of Methodism: Pandaemonium 47 (Wesley), 70 (the Mob), 86 (French Rev), 100 (Cotton
works at new Lanark), 137 (1812, Felling colliery disaster: impact on Davy)

substructure? Culture too
Also concept of “scientific revolution” – which Christian puts as part of “culture”
Others emphasize more things that are peculiar to Britain
Return to Margaret Jacobs and Lewis Mumford: cultural “pre-adaption” as well as geographic
Clock: scientific attitude: Weber’s thesis on The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism
Jan DeVries, “the industrious revolution”
Contemporary analogies? Commercial cultures – “clash of civilizations”
Readings in Pandaemonium on this: 125 (also 121, 85)
Hobsbawm:
Interest in science in England but most of all “private profit and economic development had been
accepted as the supreme objects of government policy. For practical purposes the uniquely
revolutionary British solution of the agrarian problem had already been found.” (31) Enclosure
Acts 1760-1830 swept away “ancient collective economy of the village” – farming was for
market
agriculture: second agricultural revolution – enclosures, another tragedy of the commons (Garrett
Hardin) – Karl Polanyi, The Great Transformation: how you think about the world -
privatization of world
Pandaemonium 103, petition against enclosure
Also return to agr as described in Christian text – how British agriculture was transformed by
commercial capitalism (go to reading notes)
Summary of pillars:
new technologies (mechanization)
reorganized business practices (not just factories)
new sources of energy (from wood and water to fossil fuel, esp. coal)
new materials (iron)
relation to nature
dominance of industry in national economy – decline of farming, silviculture, crafts –
Mumford on “eotechnic” – wood, wind, water complex – wood above all, both as material and
energy source (eotechnic, paleotechnic, neotechnic)
2

Concentric circles that become feedback loops
Energy crisis of 18th century – running out of wood/charcoal (Haiti analogy) anyway - esp. when
coke began to be used for ironmaking – importance of American forests (also for masts) –
concept of “reverse salient”
Traditional method of smelting iron mixed fuel and ore so they would react chemically – lime,
wood, ore in a furnace
Coal/coke as source of energy for iron-making – various efforts in 1600s – key is to keep coal
separate from iron ore so latter is not contaminated with impurities in the coal esp. sulphur
Abraham Darby 1709 – came into common use only in midcentury – no theoretical basis, just
tinkering – “carbon” and “oxygen” unknown entities – larger blast furnace, higher temperatures
– blast furnaces in Coalbrookdale – brittle - nails
This produces pig or cast iron – useful for cast iron pots and kettles (thinner and cheaper) -
His son AD II built furnaces not far from Coalbrookdale that produced bar iron, which could be
forged into other consumer goods
converting it to wrought iron is “puddling” – pig iron made with smeltinig with coke was brittle,
crumbled under a hammer – problem was to produce a pig iron that could be turned into wrought
iron – this was through the “puddling” process using coal invented same year as Watt’s engine,
1784 – Cort: “stirring molten pig iron on the bed of a reverberatory furnace. The puddler turned
and stirred the molten mass until, through the decarburizing action of air which circulated
through the furnace, it became converted into malleable iron…contact between the metal and the
raw coal that served as fuel as avoided…” (Singer IV 106)
British iron production increased 10 times from 1700 to 1800 – before then had imported iron
ore from Sweden and Russia – new processes meant they could use native ore – Britain became
an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured wrought iron consumer goods
From 1788 to 1850, forty times
To Learn more about the Bedlam Furnaces, see: Iron Furnace Ruins on Waymarking.com.
Using iron for bridge building e.g. Shropshire, Abraham Darby III, 1778;
Desolation of land: Part of the exploitive relationships mentioned by Thompson
Pumping problem
Newcomen’s engine invented 1712 – obscure ironmonger – idea of condensing steam in a
cylinder and creating a partial vacuum so atmospheric pressure would drive the piston – cold
water injected into the cylinder (from a cold water reservoir) to condense the steam – alternate
heating and cooling of the cylinder
3

used in Newcastle area – first industrial landscape (Defoe on mountains and pits of coal) –
clumsy, used so much fuel, but 57 in the area in 1767
Waterwheels remained main energy source in l8th c England – some tried to even out seasonal
differences by using a Newcomen engine to pump back used water (i.e. had gone through the
wheel) – a sort of mechanization of the water cycle
Also various experiments to make it more efficient – e.g. Smeaton, doubling efficiency, same
basic design
Watt: story that he had applied Joseph Black’s theory of latent heat to arrive at separate
condenser – “claims have been discredited” - Theory of steam engines only developed
afterwards, by Sadi Carnot in 1820s – Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire (1824)
Latent heat of steam (1757, Univ of Glasgow) – atmospheric steam (at 212) will heat six times
its own weight of water (from room temperature to 212) without itself dropping in temperature at
all
condensing steam in separate vessel kept cold outside, so cylinder stayed hot much more
efficient and also had rotary motion needed by industry – low pressure
Pandemonium 51
idea 1765; patent 1784; partnership with Birmingham manufacturer Boulton – leased the
machine, charged only for a percentage of the savings in the cost of coal over the Newcomen –
developed reciprocating steam engine: rotary not pumping motion
Flyball governor
To learn more about Wyatt’s flyball governor, see: I SELL HERE, SIR, WHAT ALL THE
WORLD DESIRES TO HAVE – POWER.
first use of steam engine other than for pumping: 1776, to blow a furnace making iron: furnace
enginers (Singer IV 104)
so much cheaper, could be set up anywhere – 500 of them in Britain in 1800
mines much more profitable thereafter – remember Mumford again - Accidents: coal mining,
safety lamp 1816
Relied on atmospheric pressure, so large – could go on a steamboat but not land
Trevithick 1800 high-pressure design (reputed to be unsafe, and who cared at the mine shaft, so
not much market: - tried to market it in Peru! (high altitude) – returned and put it on a track as a
novelty
4

Pandaemonium 119, 130
Oliver Evans high pressure engine – performance based not on condensation but on immediate
effect of steam pressure
Railways first used, again, in Newcastle area – criss crossed by railway network - rails had long
been used in mining areas – change from horses to steam power
1814 – George Stephenson, first steam locomotive
Liverpool and Manchester 1830
Parkside is famous for being the station where William Huskisson MP was injured during the
opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. After alighting from the 'Northumbrian',
which had stopped to take in water, Huskisson was struck by another locomotive and later died
from his injuries.
Pandaemonium 174
Boom in 1840s – you need iron to build the railways (steel still expensive)
More demand for coal
Textile production
John Kay 1733, flying shuttle (he was initially a clockmaker) – cottage industry – remember
“secondary” effects of Neolithic Rev - harassed by weavers, moved to France - improved
weaving but then left a “reverse salient” in spinning thread
Spinning depends on thumb and finger to give twist to make fibers into yarn – how to replace
fingers? Idea of rollers
Mechanization of spinning in 1760s and 1770s (before steam engine) as well as cylinder carding
1775 - Three stages: (Mokyr, Lever, 96-98)
Arkwright introduced power-driven spinning frame in 1770s – called “water frame” or “throstle”
– two pairs of rollers, moving at different speeds, separated by a distance equal to length of
longest fiber to be spun (from spindle, on which is mounted a flyer, with rollers between it and
the bobbin) – didn’t work with fine yarns
Spinning jenny patented about the same time (James Hargreaves) – saw a spinning wheel fall on
its side and continue to spin for some seconds – you could impart the twist not by moving fingers
but by correct turning of the wheel itself – “The jenny twisted the yarn by rotating spindles that
pulled the rovings from their bobbinis, with metal draw b ars playing the role of human fingers
guiding the spun yarn onto the spindles by means of a faller wire. Instead of the single spindle
turned by the spinning wheel, Hargreave’s machine used many spindles and thus allowed a large
number of threads to be spun at the same time.” (Mokyr, Lever, 96)Low quality yarn, ,however,
good only for weft, and adult spinners had to bend nearly double
5

Third: Mule, “ultimate spinning machine,” Crompton 1779 - “a carriage that was driven back
and forth. In so doing, the spindles mounted on it turned quickly and together with the rollers
imparted the twist on/ the yar, which could then be wound onn bobbins. At no stage was the yarn
subjected to much strain, and thus the chances for breaking were much reduced.” Made cotton
yarn much cheaper, stronger, and finer than ever – all cotton cloth now possible (Mokyr, 97-98)
– takes dyes well, launders easily, ventilates well – lent itself to mechanization more than wool
or linen (Mokyr, 100-02)
now weaving was the reverse salient –
Mechanically powered looms beginning 1785 – first water then steam – perfected 1792 by
Cartwright – also cotton gin 1793
Productivity in cotton industry went up 200 times between 1764 and 1812 (proto-Moore’s law)
1813, 2400 power looms; 1833, 100,000 of them – in between Luddites, 1811-16, as hand-loom
weavers lost their livelihood (same story as with “enclosures”) – would be repeated later when
mechanized textile production was exported to e.g. India (Gandhi)
Riots – burning of a mill using Cartwright’s power looms – remember fear of French
revolutionaries (“communists” analogy) –
Mokyr, Lever, p. 257: “In the sw of England, esp. in Wiltshire and Somerset, resistance to
advances in the spinning and weaving of wool was strong and may have contributed to the shift
of the center of gravity of the woolen industry to the northern counties.”
Also “Captain Swing” riots vs. threshing machines in agr in s of England
Urbanization of Britain: half of population as early as 1830; Germany only 1880; France not
until 1930
Letting the country go: Repeal of Corn Laws, instituted 1815, in 1846 – to preserve high land
values as they had inflated during the wars – landowners dominated in government –
Manufacturing interests allied with common people (after Reform Act 1832) – Anti Corn Law
League – manufacturers, merchants, bankers, traders – against protectionism, wanted free trade –
succeeded in 1846
importing another kind of energy, to run people – sugar – what you eat and how you work
Nature in the mine – wood to make shafts and corridors – pack animals – people – water
Value of bison hides in providing leather belts for steam engines (before rubberized belting) –
size, strength and quality better than cattle hides
6

Sugar cane – western Asia, learned in crusades – Cyprus – irrigation – islands off west African
coast (Portuguese; plantation crop) finally Caribbean – 1513, a sugar mill built in what is now
Haiti – then Brazil – irrigation, milling, burning cane trash – ceased to be an exotic luxury item –
fuel for IR (Mintz: an agro-industry) – sweet tea, jam

Crystal Palace celebration (glass and iron; greenhouse)
Military implications – Wm McNeill on this
Levee en masse
Enabled Britain to beat Napoleon – everything came together in 1793 – England paid for the
wars and also for coalitions – navy wall
Revenues in 1793 of about twenty million pounds; 22 years later, nearly 80 millions (four fold,
three fold discounting inflation)
American cotton to England: went up 100 fold 1792-1800 – and four times that in 1810-11
(before war of 1812) – no other market then
Civil War
Democratization of luxury, including small arms
American system of production – first applications in military armories (where cost was no
object) – only slowly to civilian products, first sewing machines, wooden furniture, agricultural
machinery such as reapers, bicycle – finally Henry Ford assembly linne – mass prod needed
interchangeable parts, not the reverse – division of labor, business philosophy, large output,
technological system all required
Hobsbawm, again:
“The Industrial Revolution was not indeed an episode with a beginning and an end. ..its essence
was that henceforth revolutionary change become the norm. It is still going on…(p. 29)
7

Concept of “technological regimes” or waves of innovation -– main point is start of process of
change that is so rapid and has such dramatic effects on human habitat

Battle of the Milvian Bridge, 312

Eusebius , Life of Constantine 1.28
About midday, when the day was already on the
wane, he said he saw with his very own eyes
the victorious sign of the cross composed of
light situated above the sun and linked to it the
writing: ‘By this conquer!’ Upon this vision, I am
told, astonishment seized both him and the
whole army, which was marching with him and
saw the miracle.

The Conversion of Constantine
The ‘official’ version – Eusebius, Life of Constantine 1.27
Constantine also considered the fact that he would need more
powerful aid than military might could give him, since the tyrant [i.e.
Maxentius] was making great efforts to obtain evil arts and deceitful
magic spells. He sought a god to be his helper and depended on the
soldiers and size of the army only in second place. For he thought that
that was of no use anyway without the help of a god. He considered
divine aid to be invincible and unconquerable.
So now he thought seriously about which god he should enlist as
helper, and it crossed his mind that most previous rulers had put their
hopes in several gods when they came to power and had worshipped
them with offerings of wine, sacrifices and votive offerings. Having been
initially deceived by positive prophecies and oracles that promised good
auspices, they did not, however, come to an auspicious end. Not one of
the gods had stood by them to protect them from the ruin which was
destined by heaven.

12

The Conversion of Constantine
The ‘opposition’ version – Zosimus 29
Without any consideration for natural law he killed his son Crispus, on
suspicion of having had intercourse with his stepmother, Fausta. And when
Constantine’s mother, Helena, was saddened by this atrocity and was
inconsolable at the young man’s death, Constantine, as if to comfort her, applied
a remedy worse than the disease: he ordered a bath to be overheated, and shut
Fausta up in it until she was dead.
Since he was himself aware of his guilt and of his disregard for oaths as well,
he approached the priests seeking absolution, but they said that there was no
kind of purge known which could absolve him of such impieties.
A certain Egyptian, who had come from Spain to Rome and was intimate with
the ladies of the court, met Constantine and assured him that the Christian
religion was able to absolve him from guilt and that it promised every wicked man
who was converted to it immediate release from all sin. Constantine readily
believed what he was told and, abandoning his ancestral religion, embraced the
one which the Egyptian offered him.

"STS.464 :: The Intellectual History of Technology
Modernism: Socioeconomic and Aesthetic 12 April 2005
Coming Up
Last day of class: we will meet early for lunch. Be prepared to talk about the central idea of your
paper.
George Kateb’s essay anticipates DeLillo: White Noise as death fear, the remaking of the world
as our answer to mortality, a sort of collective neurosis of humans.
New York Times Op/Ed recently: Culture of Death/Culture of Life, current events surrounding
Terry Schiavo
Discussion of final paper: 5­10 pp, double spaced, typed; perhaps think of it as a manifesto...
Last Class: Revisiting Systems
How do we envisage the relationship between ordinary life and this “network society”? How does
it cope with our creaturely, animal needs? Leo wishes Castells would address this.
The system doesn’t obliterate our creaturely being. Is this a problem for the systems folks?
Are these needs simply constrained by the system? Do the needs keep coming up against the
system?
Castells’s description is not necessarily an approving one.
THese systems arose to address bodily needs, but in the late 20th century they also around
discomforts as stong as those they satisfy.
Sewer systems as making invisible such things: removal from our own waste, bodily processes?
Today in Class
Everyone will talk a bit about their papers so far.
50 years ago today: Polio vaccine (12 April 1955)

Discussion of Readings and Papers
Laura’s Paper
• dislocation theme
• people transformed by the machine, the soul
• “the machine and the soul”
• response of the imageless art in the art world
• technology is material: abstract art aligned with this dissociation from the material? also,
an indivicual, personal expression of it
• The Education of Henry Adams
– Henry Adams’s “historical neckbreaking”
– See the paragraph in The Education of Henry Adams, Chapter 25, p. 382 beginning
with “Historians undertake to arrange sequences...”
– “Chaos is the law of nature; order is the dream of man.” −→ motto for today’s class
and an encapsulation of Henry Adams’s theory.
– Also, see Chapter 33, p. 474, the paragraph beginning with “A dynamic theory...”
– Logic connecting the force to the neck­breaking: “the sudden irruption of forces totally
new”?
Melissa’s Paper
• The Education of Henry Adams, Chapter 33, p. 476, the paragraph beginning with “To
the highest attractive energy...”
– force inside (which leads to education; which names these forces; which creates new
forces)
– forces of nature
– The Dynamo and the Virgin
∗ reproduction, fertility, the infinite
∗ sublimation
∗ attests to the power of reproduction by denying it
∗ hunger −→ desire
∗ forces wholly new that you can’t see
∗ the power of religion and the power of technology
• the dialectic between the material and the soul
Leo on the Papers
Two views of abstract art and the mechanic arts:
2

1. abstract art as a protest against materialism
2. nonrepresentational art takes away the subject matter, the image, and puts the emphasis
on the materials of the art itself
Can it be both a protest and a new way of celebrating the technical? A protest against represen­
tation?
Emphasizing the madeness of the thing (the (art) object)
Thomas’s Paper
Discussion of cinema...
Art as technology without function?
A new realm of representation?
Seeing beauty in new ways, stretching of the mind/reframing required.
−→ Does this go against/supercede the physicality of being moved in the same way? Appreciating
it in a different way? “Supersensual”?
Exmaples of historical neckbreaking:
• Einstein
• electricity
• Curies, radium, the X­ray
Modernism: breaking up of traditional narrative structures, intoxicated with the tool of the
camera, voracious eye (e.g. Ulysses).
Around the Table: An Overview of Everyone’s Paper
• technology and gender, woman/femaleness, sex
scientific motherhood
professionalization of womanhood
modern art as museless art
• gendering of nature, virgin
conception of force
phenomenon of exhibitions and what they choose to put on display
• force and machines
nature and machine
3

yearning for the divine and the conflation of these
film similar to exhibition: trying to see everything
representation of the world
city and world
technology of movie cinema
instrument through which the filmer’s desire is captured
the chaos of the city
consumer and products (department store!)
• how modern art could be viewed as resistance to appropriation of nature by machine
futurist manifesto as ultimate appropriation
• Coney Island, emergence of amusement parks
speed related to amusement parks
anticipation of what will happen next
• fusion of organism and mechanism, people + machines = system
supersystem
“technology” needed to talk of this fusion
close relationships to capitalism
modern art as a reflection on this accelerating fusion
can no longer be decoupled
• disullusionment with technology
blindness of faith in progress and technology
using technology to teach children
existential issue
• shift in perspective given by plane and automobile
acceleration
the physical feeling of acceleration
seeing things faster/from a distance
frames of reference and Einstein
– interesting analogy to our problem
– need a new paradigm
– the machine doesn’t fit anymore
– gaps in the industrial/machine paradigm
how Adams anticipates this
Apollo photos of the earth
• phenomenon of exhibition in displacing power
removal of machine from it scontext and placing it in the exhibiton
comparison of these exhibitions
art is an analytical mechanism
4

technology mediating between art and machine
• how technology and art are related
• Veblen and the machine process
art (non­practical?) and engineering (practical?)
• new relations between mechanic and fine arts
how futurists responded to new machanic arts (e.g. the automobile)
the removal of the machine from the factory
levels of detachment, interactions
artists becoming engineers?
machanic arts’ relation to production and consumption
maybe this is why Marx didn’t need “technology”
connections with labor −→ labor drops out
• concentrating on a passage from The Education of Henry Adams
the power of naming and language
the accomplishment of language
naming: calling forth a thing, congregating around the name
cohesion around the name −→ a form of control
technology as naming
facilitating the process of developing new things
Chapter 34, page 498, the paragraph beginning with “To educate — one’s self to begin
with...”
– we’ve always reacted to technological change, but next time we’re not going to be
fast enough
– exponential enlargement of force/power of humans
Next Week: Engineering
The role of engineering in modern education.
Post­WWI, 1930s −→ a challence of mechanic arts, crisis of international capitalism, trying to
think of alternatives
Veblen: idealist of the machine age, engineers’ value system puts efficiency at the top, engineers
as moral superiors
Technocracy movement of the 1930s: “technology” now a safe term, the psychic effects of
working with machinery
Noble: chemical and electrical engineering

Lives of the Emperors
Aurelius Victor, 24
The emperors after [Severus Alexander],
more concerned with tyrannizing their
subjects than subduing foreign peoples, and
with warring among themselves, precipitated
the Roman state into a steep decline. Then
good men and bad, nobles and low-born, and
even many barbarians, were indiscriminately
elevated to the purple.

He was made prisoner by the Persians and lost not
only that power which he had exercised without
moderation, but also the liberty of which he had
deprived others. He squandered the remainder of
his days in the abject form of slavery: for whenever
Shapur, the king of the Persians, who had made
him prisoner, chose to get into the carriage or to
mount on horseback, he commanded the Roman to
stoop and present his back…

Since the public officials have met and have
accused the bankers of the banks of exchange of
having closed them because they are unwilling to
accept the sacred currency of the Emperors [Macrian
and Quietus, probably], it has become necessary that
an injunction should be issued to all owners of the
banks to open them and accept all currency, except
what is completely mis-struck and counterfeit, and give
change for it.

"STS 007 Class Notes class 17
Second Industrial Revolution
Pivot point: 1850 – bring together European and American history – will go to MIT and US on
Thursday
Crystal Palace 1851 - middle class (vote, after 1831) – Corn Laws repealed 1846 – but enormous
worry about working class – Irish famine-
1848 revolutions “Spring of nations”
France, Germany, Italy, Denmark (Russia and A-H)
Democracy, liberalism, nationalism, socialism
US in 1850
To learn more about the US in 1850, see: The Compromise of 1850
Individuals vs. collective in victory:
Tolstoy reading – about War and Peace, Napoleonic victories (and also retreat from Moscow) –
the spectacle of millions of men in motion – “revolution” – causality: looking for laws – “change
the subject” - Two fallacies: beginnings and endings, individuals –
Tufte’s famous representation
How does it change how you think about “technology in history”?
Schivelbusch The Culture of Defeat
How you think about “technology in history” – three examples: Civil War, France, Germany –
Dower’s Embracing Defeat (we will read Hiroshima)– “losers in battle, winners in spirit” –
savage winners, fear of being overrun by barbarians – borrowing technology and organization in
service of higher cause
Theme of “unconditional surrender” – Sherman and Grant
South affirming white supremacy – slavery a fatal misadventure (69) – now there will be a New
South – “the Cold War of Reconstruction” (73) – go back to status quo under different
arrangements – but military occupation, Northern rules – led to repression – ten years – black
codes – things began to settle down – economic colony (84)- low per capita income, a third to
national average
1

Much more “civilized” to Europeans than Yankees – read p. 46 – a second war for independence
Capitalist but with another knightly spirit – technological-economic modernity and feudal-
romantic spirit (54)
Choice of two kinds of exploitation/production (energy)
[“For Obama,” Mr. Remnick concludes, “the black freedom struggle defines not just the African-
American experience, but the American experience itself” — the story, as Mr. Obama has
observed, that “we as African-Americans are American, and that our story is America’s story,
and that by perfecting our rights we perfect the Union.”]
Ends with… On Falling” – Soviet defeat in Cold War – third stage of global cold war in 20th c.,
only economic not military – “skipped over the actual process of destruction on the battlefield” –
“globalization” the new buzz word –
Pub. 2001 - American defeat, unemployed as vanquished – 9/11 as merchants’ tower – “to fall” –
1975 evacuation photo – shadowy adversary but you go after Afghanistan, exorcising Vietnam?
(294)
Discussion of The Communist Manifesto – the different sections
Written late 1847 (secret) trans into English 1850
(background: Marx connecting with Engels, in exile in London)
To learn more about the Communist League, see: The Communist League.
Christian’s comments: political movement, historical analysis – one of century’s two great
excavators (the other being Freud)
Remember earlier reference to “prehistory” – footnote about recorded and non-recorded social
organization (how he defines history) – “primeval communities”
Most important: what is generating new technologies, what their implications are
Class struggles – simplified
2

“revolutionary element” was new world, new exchanges” : disc of new world, modern industry,
world market (is “technology” mentioned?)
Series of revolutions in production and exchange - read
Substructure for political changes: development of the bourgeoisie – “the executive of the
modern state….” (today?)
Cultural results – “disenchantment” idea that S. uses – constant revolution has been introduced –
second, third, many industrial revolutions
Also globalization is inherent – business disrupts nations - cheapness
New wants
Intellectual results: world literature
Urbanization: idiocy of rural life
centralization
Tone? “more massive and more colossal productive forces…”
Irony, contradiction of capitalism: its own gravedigger, just as feudal society was (European-
centric)
Commercial crises: too much production, too much civilization, destabilize bourgeois society
which cannot assimilate the wealth it has created (contrast with Malthus)
Creation of wage-earning class – mass of workers, gathered together, slaves to machine
Development of class consciousness - technological unemployment – things are sped up –
unions, some rules (10 hours bill) - “special and essential product” – what’s inevitable
2nd section on essential claims – working men have no country – abolition of private property
Criticizes other types of socialism, including the neo-feudalistic
Second Industrial Revolution - Mokyr: 1870 – 1914 – last third of century
Slide
A jumble of stuff – as I say in Retooling, steel, chemicals, autos, cinema, electricity, turbines…
3

The cautionary note: Edgerton on “technologies in use” (Haiti: charcoal, bicycle, corrugated
aluminum) – above all
Making same mistake as Tolstoy warns about: small units not integrals; details not “laws of
change”
Slide
1. But continued realization that constant revolution was now the norm
2. Method: laid way for more revolutions/waves to come – changed relation between
knowledge and power
Mokyr: much more of a scientific base: chemistry, metallurgy, thermodynamics
3. Part are grids: electrical; subways, automobiles/highways, trolleys (Friday), telephone
Move from things to systems – stress that they are envirotechnical systems
Not sweeping away the old as reinforcing and extending – layering (global IR: Roe’s class)
4. More dispersed, beyond Britain - esp. Germany– also Russia, Sweden, Netherlands,
North American; beyond West in general : India, Japan, Africa – Hobsbawm: the age of
empire, both classic imperialism and more general type) – Lenin’s theory
– intl trade tripled 1880-1913 – state rivalry – but Britain dominant in shipping, finance
Continuing major themes of IR
SLIDE
Railway system – reinforced – as many miles of track laid 1880-1913 as in original railways age
1850-1880 – many European countries doubled their network in these years – intercontinental
line in US - Russian railways
100,000 locomotives, of 200-450 HP, two and three quarter million carriages – huge public
works project – by 1880 2 billion people a year traveled on them, mainly Europe and North
America
Diesel engine in 1907, electrical locomotives
More locally: subways, trolleys, streetcar suburbs (Frankfurt and Glasgow, 1884)
SLIDES of Brooklyn Bridge
Building connective systems with new materials: vehicles and systems/roadways – all systems
are envirotechnical
To learn more about the Brooklyn Bridge, see: The Brooklyn Bridge.

Carried trains until 1944, streetcars until 1950
Began 1870, drawings earlier
Steam power at sea
Steel used for ships after 1870 –In 1882 ca. 22,000 steamships in the world, still less tonnage
than sailing ships – began to change dramatically in favor of steam in 1880s
steam turbines used, esp after 1900 – freight costs dropped
Slides of 1887 Jubilee Atlas (Around the World in 80 Days, 1864) First age of globalization
(Suzanne Berger) - “tentacles of progress” – POSH – Suez, Panama imagined
Effect on world agriculture - – farmworkers and farmers still made up close to half the
population (except in GB), up to 90% in many countries
Steamship and railway transport: grain markets – US and Canada after 1900: drop was ca. 52
million bushels a year in 1890s, 200 millions in 1910-13 – Argentina also (Italian laborers helped
harvest)
Grain trade: Interactions of steamboats, railways, and food distribution
Cronon on grain silos, marketing (p. 111)
To learn more about grain elevators, see: Grain Elevators
In Europe, a spectacular decline in agr profits – great depression that began in 1870s – in 1894
the price of wheat in GB was a little more than a third of what it had been in 1867 Technologies
of preservation - Mechanical refrigeration: first frozen beef plant set up in Sydney in 1861 –
chilling (just below freezing) used between US and GB before 1870 – in later 1870s, deep
freezing (14 degrees F) came in, first from Argentina to France – by 1880s beef, mutton, and
lamb from South American were being served in Europe
Canning in American civil war – milk powder (Borden) in 1850s –
GB started importing a tremendous amount of food, let her own food production decline a lot –
by 1905-9 imported 56% of cereals, 76% cheese, 68% eggs
Capitalism has to be global (Communist Manifesto) – even Conservatives in GB willing to give
up agriculture – “What capitalism exists to make, after all, is not any particular selection of
products but money.” (Hobsbawm, age of empire, 40) (but land is not like any other commodity)
Threshers, reapers – slow mechanization however – draft animals kept being used – threshing
machine was most successful, attached t o steam engines – internal combustion engine was a real
breakthrough (tractors and combines introduced just before WWI)

Use of nitrates, potassium and phosphates as fertilizers – also guano
Productivity keeps rising, but energy intensity of the whole system: Michael Pollan, Omnivore’s
Dilemma, 2007
Also mass production:
Textiles:
Power looms continued to be used, mechanized only in 1890s
lock stitch patented in 1846 by Elias Howe – Singer added foot treadle – ca. 5 times faster than
hand sewing – ca 2200 sold in 1853, 500,000 in 1870 - also shoes and carpets –
(Combing of wool which had long defied mechanization improved by a “nip machine” in 1850s,
reviving fortunes of Yorkshire worsted industries)
Development of Southern US textile industry 1890s – continuous process of outsourcing, further
and further (black labor, terrible conditions)
“American system” of production – mechanized mass production and interchangeable parts not
the same thing – mass production didn’t need the latter (firearms, clocks, pumps, locks, reapers,
typewriters, sewing machines, engines, bicycles)
Slides
Metallurgy: iron to steel : Bessemer 1856, converter, using carbon impurities in cast iron to make
fuel, to get desired mix of iron and carbon – also Siemens Martin open hearth process, high
temps, mixing cast iron with wrought iron, adding limestone to combine with harmful
phosphorus – blast furnaces got larger and hotter (80 feet temps of 1000 deg F)

would they give up industry too, if it clashed with financial goals?
Transition to petroleum began not so much as industrial energy source but domestic lighting -
Schivebusch
Hard rock drilling, Pa in 1859, Caspian sea 1870s, Texas 1901
First used for lighting (kerosene) – main market for first 50 years (replaced by cheap electric
power )
Then fuel-oil burning furnaces for home and industrial heating – half of industry by 1909
Then a whole new market began to arise, with automobile – internal combustion engine as
competitor to steam engine – advances in thermodynamic theory, ideal cycles – four –cycle
6

engine (Otto, later Daimler): intake, compression, combustion and expansion, exhaust (Carnot
ideal cycle) – had to have right mix of air and liquid – Daimler used petroleum instead of coal
gas for a fuel - could be turned on and off quickly
Bicycles led the way with pneumatic tires, road systems
autos began to appear in 1890s – made airplane possible (1903) – Wright bros as bicycle makers,
understanding role of pilot
by 1914 Ford sold a quarter of a million model Ts a year
SLIDE of global oil consumption
Deriviatives: secondary markets: fertilizers, plastics, synthetic fibers, pharmaceuticals,
petrochemicals
Coal and oil as fuel– turning prehistoric stored solar energy into heat – in steel mills too – Rolf
Peter Sieferle, The Subterranean Forest: Energy Systems and the IR
next class, more on this, including: by 1930 the primary refined oil product – catalytic cracking
Electricity – knowledge of properties and behavior remained meager (lightning rod was one
practical use, after two centuries of experimentation with frictional machines) – Volta’s pile
(1800) (electrochemical battery): could finally discover properties of currents – Faraday’s
discovery of electromagnetic induction 1831 – could then use mechanical means to generate
electric current – beginning of generators (and motors) – didn’t have to use shafting, pulleys,
belts, gear trains as you did to distribute water power: you could use a generator and distribute
the power to multiple motors – took 50 years to get from Faraday’s discovery to electric power
generation
SLIDE of dynamo, Pearl Street station, lower Manhattan
Electricity used for arc lamp by Davy 1808, used in lighthouses – arc lamp became practical in
late 1870s, used for public places, replacing gas light
Schivelbusch on Disenchanted night – cultural effects – things never before possible –How
electric light systems were modelled on gaslight ones
Edison’s lab in Menlo Park 1876 - Edison lightbub in early 1880s, Edison’s system in NY – by
1900 a lightbulb cost one fifth of what it had in 1880, and was twice as efficient
Hydroelectric projects – replacing canals as main type of industrialized rivers – “white coal”
Utopian visions – Schivelbusch on agriculture, medicine

Communications –Christian on communication networks
Mechanized printing press – British newspaper sold a million copies in 1890s, a French one in
1900 – rotary press, typesetting, typecasting, linotype – use of woodpulp perfected
Postal system: penny post – average no of letters sent in GB in early 1800s was two a year; by
first part of 1880s, 42 a year – millions of copies of newspapers and journals
Typewriter in 1870s (lots of people working on this)
Telegraph: Morse, grew up with railways; first submarine cable laid under Channel 1851 – but at
first most submarine cables were lost (17,700 miles laid before 1861, only 4800 operational that
year) –William Thomson/Lord Kelvin worked on this (galvanometer, short reverse pulses after
main one to sharpen the signal)
Telephone (1876)
Cinema, photography, phonograph, and radio all worked on in 1890s – radio implicit in work of
Maxwell (1865); he suggested existence of EM waves, which were demonstrated to exist by
Hertz in 1888 – Lodge and Marconi developed wireless telegraphy in 1890s; sound waves first
transmitted 1906

The rich stayed rich – in 1870 four main industrial states produced 80% of world’s total manu
output; in 1913, 72%, but total output was five times as great
But it’s not about gadgets - sharp decline in mortality rates – life expectancy (in GB from 40 to
50 years) – decline in infant mortality by about half – Pasteur, Koch, infections, insects, cooking
water
Three elements of progress: productivity/wealth creation, disease eradication, life expectancy

Chemicals: organic chemistry, Liebig in 1840s - Englishman Perkin was trying to produce
artificial auinine; accidentally discovered in 1856 aniline purple, or mauveine, replacing natural
dye mauve – magenta followed – Germans competed, developed hegemony in chemical

Honor & Glory in the Iliad:
Life After Death
Honor and glory are central to the Greek character. Since heroes are the essence
of the society from which they come, Greek heroes live their lives according to honor and
glory, in all their varied forms. Honor and glory trigger an epic war that takes the lives of
numerous men, and shape its development at every stage. The fall of Troy is “a thing…
whose glory shall perish never (Homer, Iliad 2.324)”. The goal of the Greeks is the fame
that resounds even after death, and they let nothing bar their way. The honor of the
individual, family, and community guide every action and response. Honor and glory
define the hero, and therefore are the foundations for everything that comes to pass in
Homer’s Iliad.
The concepts of honor and glory are critical to understanding the motivation of
the heroes in Homer’s Iliad1. Glory was gained by great, heroic actions and deeds and
was conferred upon an individual by others who witnessed and acclaimed the glorious
actions. Major battles provided an opportunity for many to find glory at once. Honor
was similar to glory, but while the public had to view actions and deem them glorious,
each individual maintained their own sense of personal honor which did not always
coincide with honor as defined or perceived by the masses. Honor was gained through
heroism in battle, but also through compelling speechmaking, loyalty and other noble
qualities that a person might demonstrate. Having honor and glory allowed a Greek to
gain influence in their society; as Osborne writes, ""Individuals exert political influence
according to their social standing, their rhetorical abilities, and their personal charisma,
but not according to their holding the office of ruler (Osborne, 150) 2”. An example that
demonstrates this point occurs in the Iliad amidst an argument over a possible retreat.
Odysseus, a respected fighter, makes the claim that it is “disgraceful to wait long and at
the end go home empty-handed (Homer, Iliad 2.297)”. His message is well received.
Meanwhile, Thersites, a man- and commoner- despised by all, advises the army to return
home and is struck down by Odysseus to the pleasure of the gathered crowd. Here the

respect and honor that Odysseus has achieved lends sufficient weight to his argument that
his opponent, without equivalent status, is barely allowed to retort. The honor and glory
an individual has gained increase the respect and influence he commands as well.
Honor and glory were important to the ancient Greeks because social status was
not fixed. Indeed, in the eyes of the Greeks “social status correlates closely with access
to power, but does not fully determine it (Osborne, 155).” Positions of power were not
simply inherited, and through honorable and respected actions a person could elevate
their social position significantly. This mobility in Greek culture inspires a cooperative
attitude between the local leaders and the people following them. The leaders require the
voluntary cooperation of the people under them, and only achieve that with respect and
honor. This quality allows Achilles to disobey Agamemnon and refuse to fight when
Agamemnon dishonors him by taking his prize. Many of the strategic decisions for the
army that are made throughout the Iliad are reviewed by a group of respected fighters and
elders, even though Agamemnon is considered the main leader. In book nine, facing a
rout at the hands of the Trojans, Agamemnon calls a counsel of leaders to persuade them
that the army should “run away with our ships (Homer, Iliad 9.27)” before losing more
men. However, Agamemnon’s suggestion shocks his audience, and his idea is
emphatically rejected. Diomedes states, “if in truth your own heart is so set upon going,
go… yet the rest of the flowing-heart Achaians will stay here until we have sacked the
city of Troy (Homer, Iliad 9.42)”. Agamemnon’s leadership position can easily be
transferred to another, if he begins to falter. Status could always be gained and lost, and
therefore it was necessary to continually protect your honor and resulting status while
striving for more.
Gaining honor and glory is not always simple, as there are different and often
conflicting ways of achieving status and respect. One of the more obvious methods
depicted in the Iliad is success in battle, as well as courage. Achilles and Hektor are
noted as great fighters, and both of them greatly affect a battle with their presence.
Achilles’ decision to abstain from the fighting because he was slighted by Agamemnon
carried enough weight to force consideration of defeat. “Glorious” Hektor, “who was
ever the bravest fighter of the Trojans (Homer, Iliad 6.460)”, also demonstrates extreme
courage and battle prowess by continually expressing a desire to return to battle while his
2

duties force him on errands into the city (Homer, Iliad Book 6). His brother Paris, on the
other hand, the instigator of the war, must be dragged out of the city to fight, causing
other Trojans to say “shameful things (Homer, Iliad 6.524)” about his character.
Similarly, success in athletic competitions also leads to honor and glory.
The possession of material goods as well as pretty women can be indicators of
status. However the giving of possessions is an even stronger sign of status. For
example, it was considered in the funeral games held for Patroclus (Homer, Iliad, Book
23), that the event not only honors the victors, and Patroclus, but above all Achilles, who
spared no expense in choosing the prizes.
Possession of women was important to a man’s standing and honor. Paris’ theft
of Helen struck a huge blow to the honor of Menelaus and became the initial cause of the
war between the Greeks and the Trojans. The Spartan ruler called upon his brother
Agamemnon to gather the Greek forces to forcefully persuade Paris to return Helen and
reinstate respect for the king. In this case, others sympathize with the blow to Menelaus’
honor, and Achilles and other famous Greek leaders agree to join the fight to recapture
Helen and the honor of Menelaus. The theft of Menelaus’ woman justifies the initiation
of the war, and the later theft of Achilles’ woman intensifies the war with his absence.
The Greeks had more subtle distinctions of status in addition to these physical,
and personal, demonstrations of honor. Homeric society was very community-based, as
can be seen with the collective nature of the ruling class. This communal sentiment often
conflicts with individual desires. Many times throughout the Iliad what is best for the
group is rejected for individual honor. Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon wage war
to regain honor, despite the cost of the lives that will be lost in the process. There are
multiple instances throughout the Iliad where the question of standing down to prevent
others from being killed is rejected as cowardly or weak, and the fight continues.
With the massive struggle between two of the Greeks’ greatest men, Agamemnon
and Achilles, to retain their honor in the public view, it becomes clear that there are
different views on honor within the society. Agamemnon felt his personal honor was
greater than that of the army, but Achilles calls him out as “wrapped in shamelessness,
with your mind forever on profit (Homer, Iliad 1.149)”. Both of the heroes see their
women as a sign of status and honor, but relinquishing the symbol of honor for the sake

of the army, as in Agamemnon’s case, does not necessarily diminish his personal honor.
Many other respected men, such as Odysseus, try to convince Agamemnon to calmly
return his prize, but Agamemnon is overwhelmed with the idea that he is being slighted.
In this situation, the communal sentiment outweighs that of the individual. To save lives,
Agamemnon must give up a possession, which is not viewed by the community as
dishonorable. However, Agamemnon’s perceived slight does not compare with the insult
to Achilles’ honor with Agamemnon’s appropriation of his woman. Achilles feels his
honor as acutely as Agamemnon, and declares, “I am minded no longer to stay here
dishonoured and pile up your wealth and luxury (Homer, Iliad 1.170),” as he removes
himself from the main camp. Achilles gives up the prospect of gaining certain glory on
the battlefield, and having “the Achaians [honour] you as they would an immortal
(Homer, Iliad 9.603)”, to preserve his honor off the field.
The idea of family honor adds a new level of intricacy in maintaining a balance
between individual and community honor. For the Greeks, family honor is similar to
community honor. Menelaus calls upon his brother when his honor is wounded with the
theft of Helen. Agamemnon responds to the familial need, and the community does as
well, providing more support for Menelaus’ difficult situation.
Individuals of a family, like those of a community, do not always have the same
ideas on what constitutes the proper actions to take in a given situation. Patroclus is like
family to Achilles, as they grew up together, practically brothers. Patroclus respects
Achilles’ decision to remain out of the fighting, but also desires to achieve his own honor
by inspiring fear into the Trojans by wearing Achilles’ armor, since Achilles himself will
not. His honor is shown in the elaborate ceremonies that Achilles holds for his passing,
and the extent of the mourning shown.
Hektor and Paris provide a good example of family honor by the contrast in their
characters. Hektor is undoubtedly honorable, brave, and respected, as he “learned to be
valiant and to fight always among the foremost ranks of the Trojans, winning for [his]
own self great glory, and for [his] father (Homer, Iliad 6.444)”. Like with Patroclus,
Homer describes his funeral, and the depth of mourning over his loss at length. Hektor is
mourned by the entire city, including the gods who even go so far as to protect his body
from the mutilation that the grieving Achilles tried to put it through. Unlike his brother,

Paris is liable to hang back from the fighting, and to perform underhanded dishonorable
actions. The stealing of Helen was itself a dishonorable act, but Paris also defied the
host-guest relationship which is of serious import to the Greeks. The cause of the war,
Paris “wished to give [himself] over to sorrow (Homer, Iliad 6.336),” rather than join the
ranks outside the walls. The honorable Hektor has to scold him to get him to enter the
battle. Helen, who herself demonstrates regret for leaving Sparta with Paris and
instigating a long, bloody war, is disapproving of Paris, and enamored of Hektor. Despite
his extensive personal honor, Hektor is ashamed of his brothers’ weakness for the
dishonor that it brings on their family.
The emphasis placed on the retrieval of the body and the burial, for both Hektor
and Patroclus, illustrates the Greek perception that respect and renown continue after
death, and therefore validate the struggle in life to achieve honor and glory. Achilles and
Priam both go to extreme lengths and physical difficulty to have the body of their loved
ones returned to them. Achilles had to weigh a death in battle, where his “glory shall be
everlasting (Homer, Iliad 9.412)”, against a long life without glory. Initially, Achilles
abstains from the fighting, believing the insult to his honor by Agamemnon to prevail
over the glory of the fight, but he later returns to the battle and a sure death to avenge
Patroclus. He also swears to not only kill Hektor, but to exact his revenge by mutilating
the Trojan hero’s body, while Hektor himself offers gifts for the return of his own body
(Homer, Iliad 22.338). Achilles refuses, and attempts all kinds of “shameful treatment
for glorious Hektor (Homer, Iliad 22.395)”. The mutilation of the body is an attempt to
dishonor the deceased.
Just as Achilles fought for Patroclus’s body, Priam comes for that of Hektor.
Priam begs Achilles for his son’s body, saying “I have gone through what no other mortal
on earth has gone through; I put my lips to the hands of the man who has killed my
children (Homer, Iliad 24.505)”. In doing so, Priam demonstrates how death is no barrier
to the honor and glory gained in life. Priam is not dishonored in his begging, either, as he
does so in the name of his family honor. Such a sacrifice of individual glory is honorable
in the eyes of the community.
Honor and glory were at the core of Greek civilization in Homer’s time, as the
Greeks recognized that honor and glory last far longer than any physical remnants of a

person’s life. The pursuit and protection of these qualities in all their various forms were
the driving force behind everything the Greeks did. Honor and glory made it reasonable
to go to war, to fight with friends, to lose countless comrades and to be away from home
and family for decades. In the Iliad, honor and glory were life.

"Reading Notes for Christian, Chapter 12, “Globalization, Commercialization, Innovation”
The first sentence tells you what this relatively long chapter is about. What are the three
geographic levels on which it describe this 700-year-long period of preparation? (364-66
Review again the list of factors that Christian contends are the most important determinants of
rates of innovation. (366-67)
The bulk of the chapter is devoted to two main periods within the seven-centuries covered in it:
(1) the “post-classical” period, from ca. 1000 CE to the mid- 1300s, and (2)the “early modern”
period, from around 1400 to 1700 CE. Why does Christian call these periods “Malthusian
cycles”? (367; see also 403) How and why did the post-classical cycle end? (see also 370)
While you are reading this chapter, note that Christian will often refer to “revolutions”
(agricultural, commercial, etc.). However, in his summary at the end, he states that
“Nevertheless, no revolutionary changes occurred in this period.” (403) How do you interpret
this seeming self-contradiction? How is he defining revolutions? Are they technological,
historical, or both?
Also note his constant emphasis on the ultimately global scale of “truly” revolutionary change:
global changes caused “the rise of Europe” as a world power, rather than European-generated
changes causing global ones. Christian stresses that this is a relatively new view of history (both
European and global; see esp. 403-04).
What are some improvements in agricultural technologies in the post-classical period? (367-68;
also 376) what are some important developments in population, urbanization, and
commercialization? (368-69)
How was the Islamic world an important hub for the post-classical networks? Where was its
center of gravity, and how did this shift during this period? What is “Southernization”? (371-72)
What is the effect of increasing commercially-generated wealth on political organizations (who
constitutes the elite, how the state generates wealth for itself, how states interact)? (372-73)
Christian spends quite a bit of time describing China under the Song dynasty: why do you think
he does this? What are some technological improvements made in China during this period?
Why did China nevertheless retreat from global trade networks and fail to develop an industrial
base? (374-80)
Christian then turns his attention to the early modern period. The defining and unprecedented
characteristic of this period is the coming together of previously separate world zones into a
single global exchange system. What things were exchanged? Why does the greater size of the
exchange network increase its dynamism? its disparities between rich and poor? (380-84; see
also 400)

Christian argues that despite the energy jolt of this new global system, beyond a few areas,
technological innovation remained “sluggish.” How does he explain this? Which geographical
areas were dominant during the early modern period? (384-86)
What are two ways in which societies become more commercialized in the early modern period?
(386) Give some examples of ways that rural areas can be commercialized. (387-89)
In the next section Christian presents his analysis of reasons for Europe’s rise to dominance by
the end of the early modern period. How did the creation of a global network of exchanges alter
the “topology” of exchanges? In particular, how did the Atlantic basin become such a newly
important hub? Christian looks back to the example of Sumer, ca. 3000 BCE, as another
example of a world region that becomes a vital hub. How is this explanation different from ones
that depend on “exceptionalism”? Does this analysis of emerging hub regions suggest how to
interpret contemporary changes in the balance of international trade and power? (389-90)
If European societies were not exactly “exceptional,” they were still (Christian contends)
“preadapted” to playing a leading role in the new global commercial system. What are two ways
in which they were favorably disposed to do this? (391-92)
What are some of the kinds of information that were exchanged, with significant results, in the
early modern period? Note the reference to Margaret Jacob’s work on this question. What are
some intellectual and cultural characteristics of Europe that both contributed to and strengthened
its new role as a sort of global clearinghouse for new information? (393-94)
As global exchange systems strengthened, how did this change the economic base and attitudes
of the traditional elites who lived off “tribute,” i.e.rents for land? What are mercantilist policies?
How did military organization change as states became more commercializezd? (394-7)
Now we move to factors that began to break up human ways of life that had been taken for
granted for thousands of years—most notably the expectation that most people would till the
soil; that producing food to eat would be the primary form of labor; and that cultivation and
pasturage would be the primary uses of the earth. How did these expectations begin to change?
What were the sources of pressure making them change? (398-400)
What do you think of the electrical analogy attributed to Karl Marx to explain the way that
capitalist systems changed behavior and attitudes in widespread and powerful ways? (400-401)
Christian now summarizes the significant transformations of the world during this 700 year
period and also the limits on these transformations. How is the percentage of population “living
on and off the land” a critical threshold? (401-03) When he concludes that “no revolutionary
changes occurred in this period,” what does he mean?

ASSESSMENT
CLASS PARTICIPATION 20%
Your grade for class participation will be based on the following:
1. Attendance
You are required to attend both the Monday and Wednesday lectures and
your weekly recitation.
2. Reading
You are required to complete all reading assignments in time for the
meeting with which they are associated, as indicated on the schedule. You
are also required to bring with you to lecture/recitation a copy of any
reading that has been assigned.
3. Active participation
You are expected to arrive at your weekly recitations having completed all
the reading and prepared to pose questions and actively to contribute to
the discussion of the material covered that week.
WRITING ASSIGNMENTS 60%
There are FOUR required writing assignments for this subject: THREE papers of
7 pages, ONE of which must be revised and resubmitted, in accordance with the
guidelines for CI subjects. Each paper will make up 15% of your final grade.
In order to catch any early problems as well as to allow time for thoughtful
revision, you will be required to revise and resubmit one of the first two papers
due. Students who receive a grade lower than B on Paper #1 will be required to
revise that paper; all others may choose which of their first two papers they
would prefer to revise. As part of the revision process, all students will be
required to attend a 30-minute tutorial with the writing tutor for this course,
Carolyn Cohen, at which you will have the opportunity to discuss strategies for
improving the quality of your writing.
Due dates for the four writing assignments are as follows
1. Paper #1 Monday, October 3rd
2. Paper #2 Monday, October 24th
3. Revision of Paper #1 or #2 Monday, November 14th
4. Paper #3 Wednesday, December 7th
Suggested paper topics will be circulated early in the term.
FINAL EXAM 20%
A final exam of 1½ hours will be given during the regular examination period. Full
details of the expectations for the exam will be circulated in due course.

CRITERIA & GUIDELINES FOR PAPERS
Papers receiving high grades will excel in each of the following:
Argument and Structure
Your paper should seek to convince its reader of an argument, a thesis, offered
in answer to one of the questions set. The thesis should be clearly stated in the
introduction to the paper. The body of the paper should then seek to support
your thesis by marshalling an abundance of evidence from the ancient sources in
a clearly structured, coherent, and linear argument. Finally, a conclusion should
remind your reader of the thesis you have been supporting and show how that
thesis is relevant to a wider historical context. Remember throughout that your
paper should be a work of critical analysis.
Knowledge and Understanding
Your paper should display a close knowledge of the ancient source(s) on which
your argument rests: knowledge both of the details of relevant passages as well
as of the work as a whole. Your ability to subject the sources to critical analysis
and to come to your own understanding of their significance should also emerge
clearly from your paper.
Quality of Writing
Your argument should be expressed in clear, concise, and readable English.
There should be no errors of grammar, syntax, or spelling. Precision and
elegance of expression will be rewarded.
Referencing
You must always acknowledge your sources. Please note: Every time you
either quote directly from a source or even simply refer to a source, you must
provide a full citation. Since your papers are intended to be written largely from
ancient sources, your citations will most frequently be to the likes of Herodotus or
Plutarch. It is conventional in the field of ancient history to cite ancient authors in
the text of an essay, not in footnotes or endnotes; so, for example: ‘Herodotus
here suggests…….(Herodotus, 1.5)’ or ‘Plutarch records that…….(Plutarch,
Lycurgus 9)’. Since your paper should include an abundance of ancient
evidence in support of your argument, there should be many such citations along
the way.
Should you choose to consult modern sources in addition to ancient (highly
recommended), you must be sure to provide full references here also. Such
references should usually be provided in footnotes.
Continued…

Plagiarism
Full referencing is the only way to avoid plagiarism. Any unacknowledged
borrowing of ideas, arguments, or direct quotes – whether intentional or not – is
plagiarism and must be avoided. If you are not sure what plagiarism is, go to the
MIT Online Writing Communication Center and follow the ‘Citing and Using
Sources’ link or see the Humanities Library’s publication, Plagiarism and How to
Avoid It.
Using the Internet:
There is much of use to the ancient historian on the internet. There is also a lot
of nonsense. Feel free to use the internet; but be aware that you are responsible
for being critical of the material you encounter there and will be penalized for
making use of sites that spout nonsense. As with any source, you must provide
full references to material you consult on the internet, including the title and
author of the page in question, the date on which it was written or last updated,
the URL, and the date on which you accessed the site.
Formal Presentation:
All papers must comply with the following presentational guidelines:
- Papers must be 7 pages in length.
- Papers must be typed in 12-point Arial font, with at least 1½ line spacing.
- Standard margins (1.25” left and right, 1” top and bottom) must be used.
- Papers must be held together with a paperclip (NOT stapled: all papers
will be photocopied after initial grading for reference of the writing tutor).
Penalty for Late Submission
Papers are due at the beginning of the lecture on the scheduled due date. Any
paper submitted after the beginning of the relevant lecture will be considered late
by one day. Any paper submitted on the day after the due date will be
considered late by two days, and so on. Unexcused late submissions will incur a
penalty of one partial grade step (e.g. from A- to B+) for each day late. Only
serious and documented circumstances will be accepted as excuses (e.g.
serious matters of health or other personal emergencies). Late papers should be
submitted to Prof. Broadhead’s mailbox in the History Office.

Cicero, 4.16.8
We ‘friends of Caesar’… have spent without
any qualms sixty million sesterces towards
that monumental work you used to praise so
highly – the expansion of the over-crowded
Forum, and its extension all the way to the
Atrium of Liberty. The private owners of the
land would not have sold for a lesser sum.

finds a purchaser!”

Marius’s Speech at Rome
Sallust, Jugurthine War 85
“I cannot…display family portraits or the
triumphs and consulships of my forefathers;
but…I can show spears, a banner, trappings
and other military prizes, as well as scars on
my breast. These are my portraits, these my
patent of nobility, not left me by inheritance
as theirs were, but won by my own
innumerable efforts and perils…”

…continued
“…They say that I am common and of rude
manners, because I cannot give an elegant
dinner and because I pay no actor or cook higher
wages than I do my overseer. This I gladly admit,
fellow citizens: for I learned from my father and
other righteous men that elegance is proper to
women but toil to men, that all the virtuous ought
to have more fame than riches, and that arms and
not furniture confer honour.”

On Marius’s recruitment reform of 107 BC
Sallust, Jugurthine War 86
“He himself in the meantime enrolled soldiers,
not according to the classes in the manner of our
forefathers, but allowing anyone to volunteer, for the
most part the proletariat. Some say that he did this
through lack of good men, others because of a desire to
curry favour, since that class had given him honour and
rank. As a matter of fact, to one who aspires to power
the poorest man is the most helpful, since he has no
regard for his property, having none, and considers
anything honourable for which he receives pay.”
From The War with Jurgurtha by Sallust. Translated by John C. Rolfe. This material is in the public domain.
11

On Marius’s recruitment reform of 107 BC
Plutarch, Marius 9
“Contrary to law and custom he enlisted
many a poor and insignificant man, although
former commanders had not accepted such
persons, but bestowed arms, just as they
would any other honour, only on those whose
property assessment made them worthy to
receive these, each soldier being supposed to
put his substance in pledge to the state.”

20

Appian, Civil Wars 1.57
When Sulla heard of this he resolved to decide
the question by war, and called the army together to a
conference. They were eager for the war against
Mithridates because it promised much plunder, and they
feared that Marius would enlist other soldiers instead of
themselves. Sulla spoke of the indignity put upon him by
Sulpicius and Marius, and while he did not openly allude
to anything else (for he did not dare as yet to mention
this sort of war), he urged them to be ready to obey his
orders. They understood what he meant, and as they
feared lest they should miss the campaign they uttered
boldly what Sulla had in mind, and told him to be of good
courage, and to lead them to Rome…
From The Civil Wars by Appian. Translated by Horace White. This material is in the public domain.
21

Appian, Civil Wars 1.57
Sulla was overjoyed and led six legions thither
forthwith; but all his superior officers, except one
quaestor, left him and fled to the city, because they
would not submit to the idea of leading an army against
their country. Envoys met him on the road and asked
him why he was marching with armed forces against his
country. “To deliver her from tyrants,” he replied.

Traditional Roles of the

• Creation of Law
• Declaration of War and Peace

Annals
Tacitus, 6.13.1-2
‘The excessive price of corn all but ended in rioting;
and large demands were for several days made in
the theatre with a freedom not usually employed
towards the sovereign.
Aroused by this, he (Tiberius) upbraided the
magistrates and the senate for having failed to
restrain the populace by the authority of the state;
and, in addition, pointed to the provinces from
which he imported the corn-supply, and to the fact
that he did so on a far greater scale than
Augustus.’

Claudius
Suetonius, 18
‘When there was a scarcity of grain because of
long-continued droughts, he (Claudius) was once
stopped in the middle of the Forum by a mob and
so pelted with abuse and at the same time with
pieces of bread, that he was barely able to make
his escape to the Palace by a back door; and after
this experience he resorted to every possible
means to bring grain to Rome, even in the winter
season. To the merchants, he held out the
certainty of profit by assuming the expense of any
loss that they might suffer from storms, and offered
to those who would build merchant ships large
bounties...’

Latin text by Maximilian Ihem. This material is in the public domain.

Annals
Tacitus, 14.60
The measure led to general and undisguised protests from the
common people, endowed with less discretion than their superiors, and –
thanks to their humble station – faced by fewer perils. Then came a
rumour that Nero had repented of his outrage and recalled Octavia to his
side.
At once exulting crowds scaled the Capitol, and Heaven at last
found itself blessed. They hurled down the effigies of Poppaea, they
carried the statues of Octavia shoulder-high, strewed them with flowers,
upraised them in the Forum and the temples. Even the emperor’s praises
were essayed with vociferous loyalty. Already they were filling the Palace
itself with their numbers and their cheers, when bands of soldiers
emerged and scattered them in disorder with whipcuts and levelled
weapons. All the changes effected by the outbreak were rectified, and the
honours of Poppaea reinstated.
Tacitus: The Annals. Translated by J. Jackson. This material is in the public domain.
9

Annals
Tacitus, 14.42-5
‘…the rapid assembly of populace, bent on protecting so
many innocent lives, brought matters to the point of sedition,
and the senate house was besieged…’
‘While no one member ventured to controvert the opinion of
Cassius, he was answered by a din of voices, expressing pity
for the numbers, the age, or the sex of the victims, and for
the undoubted innocence of the majority. In spite of all, the
party advocating execution prevailed; but the decision could
not be complied with, as a dense crowd gathered and
threatened to resort to stones and firebrands. The Caesar
then reprimanded the populace by edict, and lined the whole
length of road, by which the condemned were being marched
to punishment, with detachments of soldiers.’

Elements of History
Fronto, 17
(mid-2nd century AD)
It was the height of political wisdom for the emperor not
to neglect even actors and the other performers of the stage,
the circus, and the arena, since he knew that the Roman
people is held fast by two things above all, the grain supply
and the shows, that the success of the government depends
on amusements as much as on serious things. Neglect of
serious matters entails the greater detriment, neglect of
amusements the greater unpopularity. The money largesses
(congiaria) are less eagerly desired than the shows; the
largesses appease only the grain-doled plebs singly and
individually, while the shows keep the whole population happy.

Class 17 Questions for discussion
Questions on Schivelbusch, The Railway Journey
The subtitle of the book is The Industrialization of Time and Space in the 19th Century. What
does Schivelbusch mean by this? How does his use of the term “industrialization” in the context
of world experience suggest some reasons for the emergence of the word and concept
“technology” about the same time?
The epigraph at the beginning of the chapter, by RalphWaldo Emerson, begins “Dreamlike
traveling on the railroad.” What does Emerson mean by this? Why does Schivelbusch quote it in
this prominent position? How are “dreamlike” and “industrialization” connected? (Note that the
quote from “an American traveler” of 1853 also emphasizes the dreamlike quality of railway
travel.)
What are some characteristics of railway travel that Schivelbusch emphasizes?
What are some characteristics of travel by air that you would emphasize, if you were writing a
similar study of airplane journeys?
Of automotive travel?
Of bicycle riding?
What other things about this chapter especially impressed you—because they surprised you, or
because they confirmed similar experiences you have had, or because they caught your attention
for any other reason?

Questions on Schivelbusch, Disenchanted Night
The subtitle of the book is The Industrialization of Light in the 19th Century. What does
Schivelbusch mean by this? How does his use of the term “industrialization” in the context of
world experience suggest some reasons for the emergence of the word and concept “technology”
about the same time?
How does Schivelbusch contrast 19th century and 20th century modes of illumination? What does
he mean by claiming that with the tungsten filament “Twentieth-century illumination had
begun”?
There is the electric lamp, and then there is “Electrification” (section beginning on p. 64). What
is the distinction between them? How may a similar distinction be applied to other developments
in technological history?
Schivelbusch suggests that there is an analogy between the dominant technological system of the
day (electrical networks) and the prevailing social philosophy. How are they similar? Do you see
any similarities between prevailing social philosophy today and the dominant technological
system of the internet?
Once again, as with the railway journey, new technologies make possible new sensory
experiences. What are some of the most important media of illusion for which light began to be
used in the l9th century? What other new light-based experiences emerged in the 20th and 21st
centuries? Do you believe they are radically different from those discussed in the selection from
Schivelbusch, or are they more or less extensions of l9th century ones?
Once again (as in his chapter on the railway journey) Schivelbusch refers to the dream world
made possible through modern technologies. Compare his discussion of the way darkness
heightens individual perceptions (at the end of the book. p. 221) with the way early humans used
lamps and created images in the darkness of caves to stimulated experiences beyond the range of
ordinary consciousness. Are there any contemporary sites and situations that are designed to
have similar effects on human consciousness?
What other things about this chapter especially impressed you—because they surprised you, or
because they confirmed similar experiences you have had, or because they caught your attention
for any other reason?

Questions on Chapter I (Bourgeois and Proletarians), Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848)
Have you ever read anything remotely resembling this manifesto? In particular, have you read, or
do you know of, other manifestos? If you were to write one, what would it proclaim?
What are the main historical events that Marx and Engels claim, in the Manifesto, to have led to
the replacement of feudal society by industrial society?
The Manifesto claims that there are three revolutionary facts in the world of 1848: the
replacement of manufacturing by Modern Industry; the replacement of the industrial middle class
by wealthier and more powerful industrial millionaires; and the emergence of a world market.
What are the comparable revolutionary facts of the world of 2010?
This sentence -- “All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last
compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind”—
is one of the most famous of the l9th century. Why? Read it in context (going back to where the
bourgeoisie is introduced as a “revolutionary” class, and forward to where it is claimed that “it
creates a world after its own image”) and explain what this means. What is the attitude of Marx
and Engels regarding this revolutionary class?
Much of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the world-changing powers of the bourgeois
class. How does this discussion resemble current talk of “globalization”? How is it different?
The bourgeoisie create immense and hitherto unknown forces of production. They also create
immense and hitherto unknown dangers and crises. What are some of those dangers and crises?
How will it all end, according to Marx and Engels?
Have you ever read anything like this Manifesto? What elements of it seem outdated and
irrelevant to the present? What elements seem to have more lasting value and relevance?

What other things about this chapter especially impressed you—because they surprised you, or
because they confirmed similar experiences you have had, or because they caught your attention
for any other reason?

Augustus
Suetonius, 72:
• He lived at first near the Forum Romanum, above
the Stairs of the Ringmakers, in a house which had
belonged to the orator Calvus; afterwards, on the
Palatine, but in the no less modest dwelling of
Hortensius, which was remarkable neither for size
nor elegance, having but short colonnades with
columns of Alban stone, and rooms without any
marble decorations or handsome pavements.

Caligula
Suetonius, 22
He built out a part of the palace right into the Forum, and
making the Temple of Castor and Pollux its vestibule, he
often took his place between the divine brethren, and
exhibited himself there to be worshipped by those who
presented themselves; and some hailed him as Jupiter
Latiaris.
…he would talk confidentially with Jupiter Capitolinus, now
whispering and then in turn his ear to the mouth of the god,
now in louder and even angry language…But finally won by
entreaties, as he reported, and even invited to live with the
god, he built a bridge over the temple to the Deified
Augustus, and thus joined his Palace to the Capitol.
Presently, to be nearer yet, he laid the foundations of a new
house in the court of the Capitol.

Nero
Suetonius, 38
But he showed no greater mercy to the people or
the walls of his capital. When someone in a
general conversation said: “When I am dead, be
earth consumed by fire,” he rejoined “Nay, rather
while I live,” and his action was wholly in accord.
For under cover of displeasure at the ugliness of
the old buildings and the narrow, crooked
streets, he set fire to the city.
From Suetonius: The Lives of the Twelve Caesars. Translated by J.C. Rolfe. This material is in the public domain.

Nero
Suetonius, 38
Viewing the conflagration from the tower of
Maecenas and exulting, as he said, in “the
beauty of the flames,” he sang the whole of the
“Sack of Ilium,” in his regular state costume.

Nero
Suetonius, 31
There was nothing however in which he was more
ruinously prodigal than in building. He made a palace
extending all the way from the Palatine to the Esquiline,
which at first he called the House of Passage, but when it
was burned shortly after its completion and rebuilt, the
Golden House.
It’s size and splendour will be sufficiently indicated by the
following details. Its vestibule was large enough to contain a
colossal statue of the emperor a hundred and twenty feet
high; and it was so extensive that it had a triple colonnade a
mile long. There was a pond too, like a sea, surrounded with
buildings to represent cities.

Nero
Suetonius, 31
Besides tracts of country, varied by tilled fields,
vineyards, pastures and woods, with great numbers of wild
and domestic animals. In the rest of the house all parts were
overlaid with gold and adorned with gems and mother-of-
pearl. There were dining-rooms with fretted ceils of ivory,
whose panels could turn and shower down flowers and were
fitted with pipes for sprinkling the guests with perfumes. The
main banquet hall was circular and constantly revolved day
and night, like the heavens. He had baths supplied with sea
water and sulphur water.
When the edifice was finished in this style and he
dedicated it, he deigned to say nothing more in the way of
approval than that he was at last beginning to be housed
like a human being.

the private rooms of the Domus Aurea, but
were since dedicated by the emperor
Vespasian to the Temple of Peace and his

The Jewish War
Josephus, 7.158
After his triumph was finished [in AD 71] and Roman rule
was re-established on a firm foundation, Vespasian
decided to build a Temple of Peace. The complex was
completed very quickly, and in a style that beggars the
imagination.
Not only did he have enormous financial resources
at his disposal; but he embellished it with old masterpieces
of painting and sculpture. In fact, into that one sacred
precinct were gathered and stationed all the art-works that
people had been willing to travel the world over to see,
even when they were scattered. Vespasian also proudly
kept here the works of gold taken from the Temple of the
Jews.

Vespasian
Suetonius, 9
He also undertook new works, the temple
of Peace hard by the Forum and one to the
Deified Claudius on the Caelian Mount, which
was begun by Agrippina, but almost utterly
destroyed by Nero; also an amphitheatre in the
heart of the city, a plan which he learned that
Augustus had cherished.

Martial on the Colosseum
Where the starry Colossus sees the constellations at close
range and lofty scaffolding rises in the middle of the road,
once gleamed the odious halls of a cruel monarch, and in
all Rome there stood a single house. Where rises before
our eyes the august pile of the Amphitheatre, was once
Nero’s lake. Where we admire the warm baths, a speedy
gift, a haughty tract of land had robbed the poor of their
dwellings. Where the Claudian colonnade unfolds its
wide-spread shade, was the outermost part of the palace’s
end. Rome has been restored to herself, and under your
rule, Caesar, the pleasances that belonged to a master
now belong to the people.

Histories
Tacitus, 1.16
“If the mighty structure of the empire could stand in even poise
without a ruler, it were proper that a republic should begin with
me. But as it is, we have long reached such a pass that my
old age cannot give more to the Roman people than a good
successor, or your youth more than a good emperor. Under
Tiberius, Gaius, and Claudius, we Romans were the heritage,
so to speak, of one family; the fact that we emperors are now
beginning to be chosen will be for all a kind of liberty; and
since the houses of the Julii and the Claudii are ended,
adoption will select only the best; for to be begotten and born
of princes is mere chance, and is not reckoned higher, but the
judgment displayed in adoption is unhampered; and if one
wishes to make a choice, common consent points out the
individual.”

The Industrial Revolution

Eric Hobsbawm, The Age of Revolution, 1789‐
1848 (first ed. 1962)
“What does the phrase `the Industrial
Revolution broke out’ mean? It means that
some time in the 1780s, and for the first time
in human history, the shackles were taken off
the productive power of human societies,
which henceforth became capable of the
constant, rapid and up to the present limitless
multiplication of men, goods and services.” (p.
28)

the English Working Class (1963)
• Planting the Liberty Tree
• Exploitation
• The Field Labourers, Artisans, Weavers
• Goods, Homes, Life, Childhood
• The transforming power of the Cross
• Community: rituals of mutuality
• Laws against combination
• Demagogues and martyrs
• Peterloo (Manchester, 1819)

Dionysius of Halicarnassus
Roman Antiquities 1.72.2
But the author of the history of the priestesses at Argos
and of what happened in the days of each of them (i.e.
Hellanicus of Lesbos, mid-5th c. BC) says that Aeneas
came into Italy from the land of the Molossians with
Odysseus and became the founder of the city, which he
named after Romê, one of the Trojan women. He says
that this woman, growing weary with wandering, stirred
up the other Trojan women and together with them set fire
to the ships. And Damastes of Sigeum (ca. 400 BC) and
some others agree with him.

"STS.464 :: The Intellectual History of Technology
The Novel
8 March 2005
• The problem of history
• The heuristic for explaining this business of technology
• Concepts have history, embedded in a culture
• Fine arts vs. practical arts
• Practical arts traditionally the domain of women, slaves, the lower classes
What is the study of history as it pertains to our task?
1. chronology, notation about a sequence (chronicle)
2. interpreting the chronicle. identifying primary causal agents and dynamics (history)
3. looking at all the ways that the changing character of the mechanic arts intersected with
other human behaviors and institutions, changing thoughts and feelings (cultural history)
BIG change −→ after the 18th century, American, French, Industrial Revolutions
Next week: Marx, industrial society replacing feudalism
At this time, major changes in the mechanic arts: machines/engines replace animals, steel and
iron replace wood. (The US lags behind Europe’s industrial nations about 30­40 years.)
Carlyle: Signs of the Times
The Machine Age −→ a mode of the collective unconscious called “mechanism”
Ways of characterizing collective modes of thought:
• worldview
• ideology
• myth
• ethos
• utopia (?)
MECHANISM −→ CAPITALISM
static/absolute dualities (discourage thought) vs. dialectical dualities (thesis, antithesis, synthe­
sis)
Our history is moving in a dialectical process, is one way to think of it.
heuristic: a device in aid of thought (e.g. Weber’s ideal type thinking)
1

Exploring the question of the class
Atsome point, all the earlier concepts of the mechanic arts seemed inadequate, noncommunicative
−→ “technology” emerges, becomes a key word, changing character/modes of thinking involving
this concept. What were the circumstances surrounding this transition? This class is a collective
inquiry into this question.
• Need to consider what “technology” does not convey as well as what it does.
• The term “technology” is less specific, more all­encompassing and fuzzy, than “mechanic
arts.”
• A necessary but not sufficient cause for the shift is a change in the character of ma­
chines/tools.
• Be hyperconscious to anachronism: Why do we feel compelled to use “technology” applied
to Dickens and Carlyle when they didn’t use it themselves? What is going on that cries out
for it? (Hard Times is bursting with technology, but the word ain’t there!)
• Be your own pollster: when other people use the term, ask them what exactly they mean
by it.
• The form of the answer is historical: we are assuming the history of the mechanic arts holds
the answer.
Try and do this in nonspecialized disciplinary vocabulary — avoid jargon! Make your writing
accessible to a lay audience.
What about the anachronism of the term “science” (e.g. “ancient science,” “medieval science”)?
• Tolerance for older language that may seem inadequate to our contemporary minds?
• Perhaps “science” isn’t as easy to confuse. The boundaries of “technology” are much less
clear.
• The term “scientist” comes into common use around the same time as “technology,” circa
the 1830s.
Dickens: Hard Times
One proposal: Dickens didn’t use the word “technology” because he didn’t need it: he was more
interested in these “national prosperity figures.”
The Industrial Revolution was imperialist from the start, always global.
−→ reform vs. revolution
Technology: educating the public, inculcating them, strong educational program (e.g. the factory
and the school in Hard Times).
mercantile capitalism −→ industrial capitalism
mechanicanistic philosophy −→ capitalist industry
control, exploitation
2

Problematic social/economic/p olitical situation, no resolution...
Dickens’s instinctive sentiments were with the workers, but he couldn’t stomach the political
implications. In his day, there was more feeling that the class clash could be resolved than there
is today, but Dickens, despite his sympathies, didn’t back it.
Louisa: model of how to go. Standard American pop culture solution to political/social problems
−→ individual conversion.
utilitarianism: greatest happiness of the greatest number
Whitehead: You need philosophy to give science a goal, to stretch what you know.
Machines, nature, and language
• Steam engines described as elephants in a state of “melancholy madness”
• Elephant in captivity; zoos, gardens
• Powerful animal for work
• Work out of control, sad
−→ What’s the inherent logic of this in this book?
• Rational machines compared to an elephant
• enraging, furious
−→ What’s happening to nature?
• Exotic creature harnessed, imported
• Poisoning the natural world
• Natural world inscribed with mechanism
• Image of nature harnessed irrationally, the animal world being put to work
• Outrage focused on machines, not people
• Other animals: the circus
The Circus: portrayed as an oasis in industrial society where men live in harmony with nature
and animals, a model for natural redemption.
Hard Times as a women’s novel: women’s relationships with men, with each other.
Think of the role of the novel in introducing people to parts of society with which they are
unfamiliar, to which they do not have access.
Bringing this to bear on the question of the class...
Hypothesis: If we take these descriptions of Coketown as emblematic of the mechanic arts at the
time — today what comes to mind is the Internet — doesn’t this suggest why “mechanic arts”
3

needed a replacement? “Technology,” a word unfettered by dirt, poison, and smoke, cleaning up
the act of “mechanism?” A greater abstraction, perhaps leading to an erroneous/skewed view of
what “technology” actually entails? From smokestacks to clean lab benches, a fellow seated at
a computer terminal...
Postindustrialism −→ Daniel Bell, “postindustrial society” −→ increased abstraction from the
grittiness of work
Place −→ is technology grounded in place, landscape? We are increasingly abstracted from
literal places.
space of place vs. space of flows −→ does this decontenxtualize? If it’s not situated in the larger
landscape, is it less accountable, so to speak?
NO PLACE AT ALL! −→ Space loses identity: you think of things, not places (e.g. email itself
becomes emblematic of the work to be done).
The decline of the countryside as a site of working and living, the rise of the city.
Lewis Mumford’s film The City
eotechnic/paleotechnic/neotechnic
Coketown: roiling, motion −→ ever increasing stillness in “technology” (e.g. travel, digital
electronics)
E. M. Forster’s The Machine Stops (1909)
In Hard Times, all the characters seem profoundly lonely, have little physical interaction with one
another.

Augustus
Suetonius, 44
He put a stop by special regulations to
disorderly and indiscriminate fashion of viewing
the games, through exasperation at the insult to a
senator, to whom no one offered a seat in a
crowded house at some largely attended games in
Puteoli. In consequence of this the senate
decreed that, whenever any public show was
given anywhere, the first row of seats should be
reserved for senators…

Augustus
Suetonius, 44
…and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free
and allied nations to sit in the orchestra, since he was
informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed.
He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned
special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys
under age their own section and the adjoining one to their
preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark
cloak should sit in the middle of the house.
He would not allow women to view even the
gladiators except from the upper seats, though it had been
the custom for men and women to sit together at such
shows. Only the Vestal Virgins were assigned a separate
place to themselves, opposite the praetor’s tribunal.

The Accession of Claudius
Claudius was disturbed by all this and alarmed for
his own safety… There he stood in an alcove to
which a few steps led, tucked away in the dark.
Gratus, one of the Praetorian Guard, caught sight of
him, but was unable to make out his features well
enough to recognize him in the dim light… He
approached nearer, and when Claudius asked him
to withdraw, he pounced upon Claudius and caught
him. On recognizing him, he cried to his followers,
‘Here is a Germanicus: let us set him up as
emperor and move fast.’

all, however, because he had shown that the
imperial office was for sale and had put the City
in the power of the boldest spies; also because
he held the senate and the people in slight

fact that they could both kill and create a

Tacitus, Histories 1.16
If the mighty structure of the empire could stand in even poise
without a ruler, it were proper that a republic should begin with
me. But as it is, we have long reached such a pass that my
old age cannot give more to the Roman people than a good
successor, or your youth more than a good emperor. Under
Tiberius, Gaius, and Claudius, we Romans were the heritage,
so to speak, of one family; the fact that we emperors are now
beginning to be chosen will be for all a kind of liberty; and
since the houses of the Julii and the Claudii are ended,
adoption will select only the best; for to be begotten and born
of princes is mere chance, and is not reckoned higher, but the
judgment displayed in adoption is unhampered; and if one
wishes to make a choice, common consent points out the
individual.

Socrates According to Plato and Aristophanes
Although Socrates never wrote any great works or taught a class, he is
considered one of history’s greatest teachers and philosophers. Unfortunately,
before much of his contemporary public realized the benefit of his philosophical
prowess, Socrates was executed for impiety. Whether his views were a political
threat or his fellow Athenians really were offended by his alleged impiety, after
Socrates’ death, Athens regretted this injustice. In trying to understand the life of
this remarkable man, two of his contemporaries, Aristophanes and Plato give a
picture to examine. In comparing Aristophanes’ The Clouds1 and Plato’s
Apology2, it is evident that both authors have very different views of the man.
Due to the differences in Socrates’ character, this comparison also compels a
reader to question whether Aristophanes’ and Plato’s accounts are genuine.
Through examination of the two texts, it is apparent that both Aristophanes and
Plato had reason to misrepresent Socrates’ character so that only a partial image
of the man is available to both authors’ audiences.
To compare the authors’ perspectives of Socrates, Aristophanes and Plato
both lived during Socrates’ lifetime, but their associations with him differed
greatly. First, Aristophanes was born twenty years after Socrates and Plato was
born forty years after Socrates. At the time of Aristophanes’ release of The
Clouds, Socrates would have been in his forties, but Plato would have been an
infant. Plato was one of Socrates’ young followers. According to Bury,3 Socrates
attracted the attention of young men in Athens because he questioned the basis

of every thought and action of those around him. Because older men were
angered at his inquisitive challenges, younger men jumped at the chance to learn
Socrates’ dialectic method of evaluation (Bury 358). In this respect, Plato had an
amicable relation with Socrates and respected him highly as his teacher.
Aristophanes did not have any connection to Socrates other than a possible
chance acquaintance and observations of Socrates’ public actions in the agora.
Understanding these relationships gives insight on the perception each writer
may have had concerning Socrates.
In Apology, Plato writes the dialogue of Socrates’ defense of himself
against the charges brought forth by Meletus. The charges claimed Socrates
was a wrongdoer in that he did not believe in the gods of the city and thus
corrupted the youth of Athens with his infidelity. As one of the youth Socrates
supposedly corrupted, Plato came to be another of the ancient world’s greatest
philosophers. Whether he was corrupted by Socrates is questionable, but deeply
affected by his teacher, it seems most certain. Of the many works written by
Plato, at least four deal directly with the principles of Socrates and the
circumstances surrounding his trial and execution. With so many references to
his mentor, Plato is one of the modern world’s most detailed links to the life of
Socrates. Considering this, it causes many to ask how accurate Plato’s depiction
really is.
While reading this dialogue, it is necessary to consider how it was written
in order to determine its legitimacy. Plato may have recorded the dialogue during
the trial, but if he had, it is doubtful that so many scholars would place it as one of
his middle works. With this in mind, the piece may or may not have been
composed within a few years of Socrates’ execution. While not doubting Plato’s
memory, it seems likely the farther from the trial the dialogue was written, the
less accurate it is in portraying the exact words of Socrates. Fewer words
attributed to Socrates means more of Apology was created by Plato. Plato’s
creative liberality has two major consequences: one, the audience is given
access only to the Socrates Plato wants to portray, and two, the ideals and ideas
of Plato are diffused to the public under the auspices of Socrates’ teachings. For

Erickson 3
example, when he questions Meletus during the trial, Socrates tells his jurors and
his accuser that if he corrupted those around him, it was involuntary and should
have been dealt with on a personal basis, not in public court (Plato 26a).
Socrates very well could have conveyed this idea to the jury believing a hearing
was unnecessary, but Plato could also have decided to make this point in the
dialogue because he was bitter about the treatment of his venerable teacher.
Again, insertion of Plato’s own views might explain the frequent
recurrence of Socrates claiming to believe in the Gods when Socrates is
generally considered agnostic (Bury 358). Although Socrates never actually
states his own beliefs while proving himself innocent of Meletus’ charge of
atheism, he does mention “God’s will” while trying to convince the jury that he
should not die (Plato 30d). Socrates first discusses his personal religious
convictions in saying he is God’s gift to mankind (31a). Whether this is actually
where Socrates’ sympathies lie or Plato put those words in his mouth for comic
relief is a fact difficult to distinguish, but another sample of the same tone is
inserted in the last line of Apology. Socrates wittily remarks that he does not
know whose fate is better, those who will live on, or his own, which is to die (42a).
This brusque quip could easily be attributed to either philosopher, though it
sounds ironically like a threat coming from Socrates. Socrates does not make
threats anywhere else in Apology. This farewell note seems more likely the
dramatic ending Plato would include to signify that an Athenian state who would
shun his instructor deserves whatever discord it brings upon itself. If Plato is
using Socrates’ reputation to spread his own teachings, the principles that seem
to belong to Socrates in this dialogue may not be his at all.
Although the past few paragraphs have generally portrayed Plato as the
devoted student of Socrates, he may have had ulterior motives in writing this
dialogue. Examining these motives may also give insight on what Plato was
trying to convey in Apology as well as inconsistencies in his depiction. The most
obvious motives, as illustrated above, include Plato writing in admiration of
Socrates. In this case, Apology was composed as a tribute to his instructor’s
strong will. Socrates’ futile defense makes his conviction logical, because it is

Erickson 4
obvious that he makes no effort to prove his innocence. For example, Socrates
begins the defense saying not to heed any warnings of his being a “clever
speaker.” (Plato, Apology 17b) This hurts his case, considering his entire
dialogue is tricky. This is especially evident when he tries to discount his guilt in
the cross examination of Meletus. In order to make his innocence known, he
attempts to make Meletus seem guilty of having “never thought about the youth
[for which] you haled me into court.” (25c) Though unfamiliar with the intricacies
of Athenian courts, this does not seem the most effective method of proving
one’s innocence. If Plato intentionally created the dialogue to show these ironic
intrigues, the purpose would be to show his fondness for Socrates’ unique
perspective and eccentric traits, not to defend Socrates after the fact. Because
he does not attempt to prove his innocence, Plato shows readers the strength of
Socrates’ principles and that he would rather die than claim false beliefs. If
making Socrates seem of stronger will than ordinary people was Plato’s goal, it
may be necessary to embellish certain details about him so the image is
congruent throughout the dialogue. Exaggerating Socrates’ characteristics may
give the audience a false impression of who he really was.
Though less likely to be true, Plato may have had another goal in mind
entirely. Plato may have been trying to separate himself from his teacher by
showing Socrates’ undeniable guilt. If the dialogue had been written immediately
after the trial, the purpose of separating himself from Socrates would have been
to avoid suspicion. Because Socrates was likely seen as a political threat
through his encouragement of individualism, Anytus, one who helped restore
Athens against the Thirty, had reason to take him out of a position to threaten the
newly reborn democracy (Brickhouse 2.1.7)4. If Plato feared these political ties
coming to haunt him, the desire to separate his beliefs from Socrates’ is justified.
If Plato did not fear the politicians of Athens, because he probably released
Apology many years after the trial, he may have wanted to separate himself from
Socrates to show that he had come into his own right as a philosopher.

Erickson 5
Whatever Plato’s motive in designing the dialogue of Socrates, it is undeniable
that Plato had much free reign to portray Socrates in any way. Without more
sources to compare, this description may give a wrong impression of Socrates
life and demeanor.
In addition to considering Plato’s multiple motives to portray Socrates
poorly, Plato’s other works give evidence of his disregard for complete accuracy
regarding Socrates. For example, a discrepancy arises between the accounts of
Diogenes Laertius and Plato concerning the number of jurors present at the trial
and their votes (Brickhouse 75). Although no evidence points to one account
over the other, most historians accept Plato’s account over Diogenes’ because
he was not present at the trial. Although this is quite acceptable, this does not
clear up the question of how many jurors were present. At the time of the trial, it
was common practice in Athens to have an even numbered jury, where the
adoption of odd numbered juries occurred a few years after Socrates’ trial. Plato
claims 501 jurors heard the case. Despite the fact that historians credit Plato
more in this detail, the fact that a discrepancy arises brings one to question all
the details in Plato’s accounts. The most controversial detail in Plato’s writing is
the death scene of Socrates. In the last part of the Phaedo, Plato portrays
Socrates’ last days alive (Brickhouse 253). In addition to conflicting doctrines,
the science of the death scene has aroused question of Plato’s accuracy.
According to Thomas Brickhouse, Socrates’ views on the afterlife in Phaedo do
not align with his proclaimed views stated in Plato’s other writings (253). This is
a cause for concern considering most of the modern perception of Socrates’
teachings comes from Plato’s accounts. Furthermore, Socrates is portrayed as
willingly accepting his death. His sentence was execution by ingestion of poison
hemlock. After considerable study of the effects of hemlock, especially by a
Roman by the name of Nicander, results show it leads to convulsions, nausea,
thick speech, loss of feeling in the limbs, and many other unpleasant side effects.
No parallel symptoms appear in Plato’s account except paralysis (Brickhouse
259). Debating why Plato would portray Socrates’ death as more peaceful than
would be scientifically reasonable is a complex issue, but finding an

Erickson 6
inconsistency of this magnitude causes a reader to reevaluate everything Plato
claims about Socrates in all of his works.
Now that Plato’s representation of Socrates has been shown to have
possible inaccuracies and ulterior motives, Aristophanes’ depiction of Socrates in
The Clouds deserves the same analysis. Aristophanes writes a comedic play
about parodying the intellectual movement occurring in Athens. The growing
numbers of intellectuals in the city, whose ideals threaten the traditional
foundation of Athenian democracy, are depicted by a blanket characterization
under the name of Socrates. Aristophanes’ portrayal of Socrates shows an
atheistic sophist who teaches Athenian youth how to make the “wrongful
argument” seem right in a debate through deception and trickery (Aristophanes
116). Although this character has the name Socrates, it is ambiguous whether
he truly represents his namesake. Assuming Aristophanes did intend to make
fun of Socrates as the leader of this intellectual movement, it is questionable
whether he allows comedic efforts to compromise the actual traits of Socrates or
he truthfully depicts the public opinion of Socrates at that time.
Aristophanes was known as a sarcastic and satirical playwright, depicting
public opinion in a style of vulgar comedy. The Clouds was originally written for
the city Dionysia in 423 BC, but it was a complete failure in the competition.
Aristophanes revised it and this revision is the only version left to the modern
world (Sommerstein 69). The changes Aristophanes made are not entirely
known, but speculation points to only three parts having changed significantly. In
this effect, it can be assumed the play was modified to suit the audience better
than the original. One cannot be certain what Aristophanes’ intent was in writing
as he did, but the general goal of a playwright is to entertain the audience.
Therefore, his portrayal of Socrates in The Clouds is primarily ascribed to his
effort to please an Athenian crowd.
In order to understand what Aristophanes meant to impart to his audience,
it may be beneficial to explore how he represents Socrates and how this could
effect a reader’s interpretation. Considering Aristophanes’ reputation for vulgar
humor and traditionalist perspectives, the representation of Socrates’ education

Erickson 7
interspersed with the bodily functions of gnats and lizards seems to demean the
value of his intellect (160-180). This may be because Aristophanes, or more
likely, his audience, does not understand Socrates’ philosophy, or because
Socrates’ actions in public are so offensive that a lizard defecating upon him is a
better outcome than whatever revolutionary idea he may come up with next.
Later, Aristophanes refers to Socrates as a sophist (331). Although sophist
literally means educated person, the sophists of Athens at that time were usually
men who charged for an education in the skill of rhetoric (Brickhouse 88).
Socrates did not charge for his services, but instead engaged passersby in
conversation, thus influencing the young men with whom he conversed (Bury
359). Aristophanes also portrays Socrates as “worshipping” the Clouds, “patron
goddesses of the lay about.” (Aristophanes 317) This is obviously a pun
indicating Socrates believes in no divinities at all and, by instituting the clouds as
the deities of his educational institute, influences others to “believe” in the Clouds
as well. The lack of religious reverence for the Clouds becomes apparent when
Strepsiades and Socrates discuss the origin of flatulence and lightning (386).
Additionally, Socrates often swears by “Chaos, Air, and Respiration” or some
other such list of natural occurrences (628). Aristophanes pokes fun at Socrates’
philosophy to contemplate tangible phenomenon, by instead saying he worships
the quest for knowledge over any city gods. Strepsiades’ gullibility in believing
every word Socrates or his students utter indicates the social atmosphere
believing the youth of Athens are susceptible to absorbing any nonsense
Socrates might try to spread throughout the city (815). Although the above is just
a sampling of the many acerbic jabs Aristophanes makes at Socrates, it is
already apparent each needs analysis before it can be reasonably applied to the
philosopher described by Plato, which, in effect leaves plenty of room for
misinterpretation.
Although Aristophanes misconstrues the true characteristics of Socrates in
The Clouds for humor’s sake, a modern audience must also consider this version
as a second draft. As mentioned earlier, Aristophanes’ first production failed
miserably in competition. Because he was considered a popular and successful

Erickson 8
comedian, this brings one to question what would cause this unexpected
dissatisfaction of a play so characteristic of Aristophanes. For the purpose of
evaluating his representation of Socrates, the original representation may have
been the factor encouraging him to change the play. Two situations, then, could
have been the cause. For the first, Aristophanes’ original version of The Clouds
may have depicted Socrates in a much more negative light. In this case, the
Athenian public had no reason to dislike him, and Aristophanes’ comedy was
really too mean to gain favor. If this was the audience’s response, the revised
play is more likely to show what Athenians thought of Socrates. In the second
case, Aristophanes’ original depiction of Socrates was too nice, and the Athenian
public disapproved of such tolerance of the man degrading the city’s integrity. In
this case, the portrayal of Socrates in the revised version would be more
outrageous than can be considered a reasonable representation. Either way,
Aristophanes tailors the character to his audience, giving doubt to its accuracy
altogether.
The tone Aristophanes adopts for his play may also give insight on his
portrayal of Socrates. The plot is rather bleak, an uncommon trait for a comedy.
This somber tone may have been Aristophanes’ contempt for his original
audience’s response, or Aristophanes’ contempt for Socrates. In the latter case,
it would make one question what Socrates did to offend Aristophanes to deserve
such ridicule. If Socrates had personally offended Aristophanes, each of his
traits would be magnified for the worst in The Clouds. If this bleak tone instead
comes from contempt for his audience’s disapproval, the revised play may have
shown his indignation. For example, Aristophanes may have taken out his anger
for the crowd on Socrates’ character by portraying him more corrupt and vulgar
than he may have been in reality in order to reflect badly on the society in which
Socrates belonged. Though uncharacteristically “compassionate” for
Aristophanes, he could also be showing disdain towards the audience because
the Athenian society does tolerate Socrates’ presence even when he is obviously
a negative influence on the city. If the tone Aristophanes uses for this piece is in

Erickson 9
any way related to his depiction of Socrates, it would indefinitely make Socrates
seem more of a miscreant.
However accurately (or lack thereof) Aristophanes intended to portray
Socrates, his play obviously had a profound impact on Athens’ opinion of the
man. The Clouds was performed twenty years before Socrates’ trial, but
Socrates practically begins his defense by assuring the jury it was a fictitious
work (Plato 18d). Ironically, though, the charges brought against Socrates by
Meletus parallel those traits presented in Aristophanes’ comedy (24c). Though it
seems rather ironic that the charges that resulted in Socrates’ death would be
identical to the claims made by Aristophanes two decades earlier, this may have
been less coincidental than it seems at first glance. Obviously, Aristophanes’
comedy could have fueled public opinion, so that a few years after the idea was
introduced, public awareness finally made Socrates too great a threat to
Athenian ideals. It is equally as likely that Meletus did not have sufficient
evidence to convict Socrates of any other crime; therefore, accusing him of a
long-standing community myth was a last resort to take him out of the political
arena. That this accusation gained support implies at least a few saw it to be
true.
It becomes apparent that both Plato and Aristophanes had reason to
portray Socrates inaccurately, but this entire concept of accuracy depends on
what a reader considers a valid account of a person. The challenge of accuracy
is to determine whether a man is defined by the way others see him or whether a
man is defined as he sees himself. In light of this definition of “accuracy,” Plato
and Aristophanes may both have dependable information despite their
differences. Because Socrates begins his defense by denying Aristophanes’
claims, he effectively tells the reader he expects much of the jury believes these
claims. Plato was intimately related to Socrates as his student, thus his
description of his mentor might be either the Socrates he remembered or the
Socrates he wanted to share with the world. Whatever Aristophanes and Plato
intended to share with their readers fits within this criterion for accuracy.

Erickson 10
Aristophanes and Plato both seem capable of misrepresenting Socrates in
The Clouds and Apology, either through partiality, ulterior motives, or for the sake
of humor. That both seem capable does not mean the Socrates described is
altogether inaccurate, though, either. This lesson shows a reader should
carefully discern the undeniable truth from the speculation and conveniently
altered characteristics an author will include in a description. Relying too heavily
on an author’s portrayal can prevent a reader from realizing the complexities
presented by other sources as well as stealing a reader’s chance to make
connections and investigate the man behind the written words. Although he may
not be perfectly portrayed, the pieces of Socrates’ character found throughout
historical record still paint an intriguing puzzle for modern readers to ponder."

so to speak, of one family; the fact that we emperors are now
beginning to be chosen will be for all a kind of liberty; and
since the houses of the Julii and the Claudii are ended,
adoption will select only the best; for to be begotten and born
of princes is mere chance, and is not reckoned higher, but the

Digest
Ulpian, 9.3.5.1-2
If the apartment is divided among several tenants, redress
can be sought only against that one of them who lives in that
part of the apartment from the level of which the liquid has
been poured. If the tenant, however, while professing to
have sublet, has in fact retained for himself the enjoyment of
the greater part of the apartment, he shall be held solely
responsible. If, on the other hand, the tenant who professes
to have sublet has in fact retained for his own use only a
modest fraction of the space, he and his sub-tenants shall
be jointly held responsible. The same will hold good if the
vessel or the liquid has been thrown from a balcony.

Juvenal 3.190-6
Who at cool Praeneste, or at Volsinii amid its
leafy hills, was ever afraid of his house
tumbling down?...But here we inhabit a city
propped up by slats: for that is how the
landlord patches up the crack in the old wall,
bidding the inmates sleep at ease under the
ruin that hangs above their heads.

Crassus
Plutarch, 2
And besides this, observing how natural and
familiar at Rome were such fatalities as the
conflagration and collapse of buildings, owing to
their being too massive and close together, he
proceeded to buy slaves who were architects and
builders. Then, when he had over five hundred of
these, he would buy houses that were afire, and
houses which adjoined those that were afire, and
these their owners would let go at a trifling price
owing to their fear and uncertainty.

"STS.464 :: The Intellectual History of Technology
Ecological Crisis
3 May 2005
Discussion of Readings and Papers
Hiroshima
• understatement
• the newness of the device
• the mystery to the victims (secrecy)
• the persistence of the effects
• no symbolism, no allegory
Adam’s Paper
• anticipation and promise −→ dread
• phase shift
• “experiment” −→ world as laboratory?
• horror
• Christianity part −→ the horrific as close to the sublime (and therefore the divine?)
• bomb as “natural disaster”
– technology as a way to mask the human aspect/effects
– human technological events can feel like natural ones
– imagination of catastrophe
– George Steiner’s “disaster utopia”
– an awesomeness of scale −→ such powerful scope, it must be natural
Melissa’s Paper
• Weber −→ we live in a cacophany of ideas; the only ones that natter are the ones that are
seized upon by social groups, the ones that are politicized.
• Power −→ politics
More on Hiroshima
Novels that have led to action:
1. Uncle Tom’s Cabin −→ energized abolitionist movement
2. Melville’s White Jacket, which described the flogging of seamen −→ led to the outlawing
of the practice
3. Sinclair’s The Jungle −→ led to food & drug law
1

Why does this book not point to any imaginable action?
Association of technology with a sense of forces out of control.
There’s no call to action here.
Need for history of medicine and history of technology to meet! Medicine & tangible evidence of
progress, interfacing with technology in meaningful, magical, and transformative ways.
Kateb: Why are we all so obsessed with changing this planet? We have a fear of death.
Death­fear as motive for mindless action and constant transformation.
A fear of not controlling yourself?

"STS 022 Class Notes 4B
Cave art
Summary, looking back and forward
Course organized around four revolutions:
Human, settled agriculture, industrial, unnamed one (your challenge)
Today: last of discussions of first and fundamental: humans emerging as an inventive aggressive
species
Ultimately a question about “human nature” (note wording: are humans included? Basic
separation from rest of animals)
Startling and shocking discovery of human antiquity – so all of history gets redefined, including
tech in history
You read Mumford on “Technics and the Nature of Man” – celebrates creativity
End of chapter 7: the extinction of the large mammals, incl. maybe Neandertals (sp)
But also implies networks
Theory of demographic imbalance (2 % mortality difference, 30 generations or a millennium) –
Lewis Williams 88
Also a creative, fast-growing population – “human revolution” “creative explosion” (Lewis
Williams 96)
“creative destruction” (Joseph Schumpeter, contemporary of Veblen)
http://www.stps.metu.edu.tr/stpswp/series05/0509.pdf
To learn more about “creative destruction” see: Creative Destruction.
Second: Neolithic Rev.
Usually called “agriculture”
Christian stresses that it is something more: domestication and settlement
By definition needs a set of technologies that can feed people without hunting/foraging
A suite of technologies, a system

Christian also stresses that in hybrid form it lasted a long time: settled agr.with nomads, foragers
Think: Roman Empire and Goths
Think: America and Australian indigenous peoples; Afghanistan
Christian also stresses that this change is not necessarily progress
Raises deep question of free will: why don’t humans make inventions, new technologies that
make them happier and better off? (unanticipated consequences, foreclosing options)
Third: emergence of a civilization based on industrial production fueled by fossil fuels
Latter doesn’t get enough attention: displacement of organic sources (wind, water, muscles of
animals and people)
Vast increase in productivity; vast increase in disparities
Marx: “prehistory” is over, it’s a new human condition
The unnamed revolution beginning around turn of 20th century
“information” is part but not the whole
Mumford at beginning of “technics and human nature” – an artificial world – no more beyond
the human
Remember Christian’s emphasis on geographical consolidation, networks, from many to one
Keep asking yourself this question as we proceed: what is it?
Keep two things in mind:
Problem with term “revolution” no matter what the modifier
Borrowed from science, then to politics, then to “industry” (Toynbee)
Image from storming of Bastille, or maybe Russian Rev of 1917: you have a government, you
overthrow it, kill the powerful and install new leaders
Christian’s comments on human revolution – it didn’t erupt in Europe in 40000 to 50000 BP
Longer development in Africa (McBrearty and Brooks article; also cited by L-W 96)
Neolithic Rev

It took a long time; they were not aware of what they were doing (consciousness); many
subinventions go into the big one of “agriculture”; and things accumulate (foraging lasts a long
long time; agriculture lasts into present; means continue to be used, are not displaced)
But inarguably a change in human condition
Second thing to keep in mind: what changes is not just material means but understanding of ends
around which the means are organized - teleology
Means accumulate but meanings succeed each other – Gauguin: where are we coming from,
where are we going, what does it mean? (In Boston Museum of Fine Arts) – ultimately
unanswerable questions, or rather answers change
To learn more about Paul Gauguin’s Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We
Going? See: Gauguin: Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?
These questions do not appear in hierarchical order (Maslow) – physical then spiritual needs
In fact they define the human revolution: symbolic mastery
Another energy source: psychic energy, what you care about, are willing to live and die for
Lots of survival technologies: weaving, pottery, dwellings, hunting tools
First sign of human is not fire, axes, but jewelry, art
meaning in kinship, tribe, fertility, a spirit world
Early civilizations: role of organized state, ruler and priests – later combines with monotheism -
we will read about Christian belief in Virgin Mary as a source of energy (Henry Adams)
Industry – “progress” defined either as democracy or as production, wealth
Now: sustainability, back to living with nature - ?
Talk about Clan of Cave Bear in this light – their tools, their ends
Symbol, art, abstraction
Language: here and now, life, death, strength, birth, sex, food
Physical weakness of the shaman
Pidgin-Aurignacian – communication - simple
“We need to distinguish between those kinds of art that can interact to produce viable new forms
and those that cannot evolve into other types” (Lewis Williams 89)
Generative grammar analogy

Could body decoration (red ochre, jewelry) evolve into two D images on a cave wall?
They signify clan membership and also stages of kinship (puberty, marriage, childbearing)
Animals that hunt other animals are singled out for display
Hunting associated with supernatural realm
Neanderthals did not take over pictures or carvings – body-painting does not evolve into image-
making – could not remember altered states of consciousness or manipulate that imagery; could
not imagine an alternative reality (spirit world); could not recognize connection between 2D and
3D
Nor burial with elaborate grave goods, nor advanced hunting strategies
Larger social networks
Face to face exchanges of artefacts and information – beyond face to face
Burial with lots of grave goods indicates social networks
Lewis Williams’ argument that the Aurignacians actively cultivated the characteristics of their
lives that distinguished them (set them “above”) the Neandertals –
Neandertals coping with new arrivals around 45000 to 35000 BP – cave art as a form of social
distinction
Cave art: what they care about – quest for meaning -
Cave painting as needing many technologies (Mithen mentions some)
Caves were handy – earth art is universal but not cave art – sealed in time by ice ages - also
portable art
The dancing sorcerer image, from Trois Freres cave, Ariege
In a very hard to reach part of the cave – part human, part animal
Font de Gaume
15-17000 BP – warmer then

One line does a mammoth
Sketched with finger first
Claw marks of cave bear - teeth

Footprint of children, teenage boy
Chauvet disc. 1994 by 3 spelunkers, one named Chauvet – in Rhone valley
Now active searching: e.g. three friends (two men, one named Chauvet, one woman) feel a
draught, remove some rubble (modern entrances often not the prehistoric ones), goes down 10 m
tunnel, find chamber, get a ladder
See mammoth, rhino, dots, handprints, horses heads, skull of a dave bear with its canine teeth
hooked over an edge, even deeper find lion heads
“we were seized by a strange feeling. Everything was so beautiful, so fresh, almost too much so.
Time was abolished, as if the tends of thousands of years that separated us from the producers of
these paintings no longer existed. It seemed as if they had just created these masterpieces.
Suddenly we felt like intruders….we were weighed down by the feeling that we were not along;
the artists’ souls and spirits surrounded us. We thought we could feel their presence; we were
disturbing them.” (imagine similar feelings in Chauvet 27000) – in book pub. 1996 quoted in
Lewis Williams 17
32000-30000 yrs ago – 22 dates
Earliest known cave paintings
2nd occupation 27000-26000 yrs BP (torch wipes, no paintings tho) – 7 dates
Maybe a third around 22,800
Foot and animal prints – foot from earliest known anatomically modern human
Esp. bears
Hearths set up to produce wood charcoal for coloring (also illumination)
Step dug - flints
Levi-Strauss spoke of myth growing “spiral-wise” until the “intellectual impulse which has
produced it is exhausted.” (in Structural Anthropology 1963) UP nexus of mental states, fixed
imagery, social relations and caves lasted until 10000 BP, long after the demise of the
Neandertals – thereafter locus of spirit world was built above ground

Clan of the Cave Bear assignment: ask how literature helps imagine a whole way of life, with
everything integrated
What are other ways to accomplish this? biographies

Views of the Compact of 60
Plutarch, Crassus 14:
… he (Caesar) saw that Pompey and Crassus were
once more at odds with each other. He therefore did not
wish to make one of them an enemy by asking the aid of the
other, nor did he have any hope of success if neither of
them helped him. Accordingly, he tried to reconcile
them…He persuaded the, reconciled them, and won them
both to his support, and constituted with that triumvirate an
irresistible power, with which he overthrew the senate and
the people…

Views of the Compact of 60
Plutarch, Pompey 47:
For those opposing forces which, as in a vessel,
prevented the city from rocking to and fro, were united into
one, thereby giving to faction an irresistible momentum that
overpowered and overthrew everything. At all events, Cato,
when men said that the state had been overturned by the
quarrel which afterwards arose between Caesar and
Pompey, declared that they wrongly laid the blame on what
merely happened last; for it was not their discord nor yet
their enmity, but their concord and harmony which was the
first and greatest evil to befall the city.

Pompey
Plutarch, 48
After this Pompey filled the city with soldiers and
carried everything with a high hand. As Bibulus the consul
was going down into the forum with Lucullus and Cato, the
crowd fell upon them and broke the fasces of his lictors, and
somebody threw a basket of ordure all over the head of
Bibulus himself, and two of the tribunes who were escorting
him were wounded. When they had thus cleared the forum
of their opponents, they passed the law concerning the
distribution of lands….

The Civil War
Caesar, 1.7
‘‘They have seduced Pompey and led him astray, through jealous
belittling of my merits; and yet I have always supported Pompey, and
helped him to secure advancement and reputation. A precedent has been
created in government; in the recent past, armed force restored the
tribunes’ veto; now armed force is repressing and overriding it…The
decree calling upon the magistrates to act to save the State from
harm…was never passed before now except in the case of pernicious
legislation, or violence by tribunes, or a mutiny of the people, when the
temples and heights commanding the city were seized; and these earlier
precedents were atoned for by the fates of Saturninus and the Gracchi.
But in the present instance, none of these things has taken place, or even
been contemplated; there has been no law proposed, no attempt to
appeal to the people, no mutiny.
I have been your commander for nine years; under my
leadership, your efforts on Rome’s behalf have been crowned with good
fortune; you have won countless battles and have pacified the whole of
Gaul and Germany. Now, I ask you to defend my reputation (existimatio)
and standing (dignitas) against the assaults of my enemies.’
(cid:55)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:58)(cid:68)(cid:85) by Caesar. Translated by Jane P. Gardner. Penguin Classics, 1976.

Julius
Suetonius, 30
[Caesar intended] to resort to war if the senate took
any drastic action against the tribunes of the
commons who interposed vetoes in his behalf. Now
this was his excuse for the civil war, but it is believed
that he had other motives. Gnaeus Pompeius used to
declare that since Caesar’s own means were not
sufficient to complete the works which he had
planned, nor to do all that he had led the people to
expect on his return, he desired a state of general
unrest and turmoil…
18

Others say that he dreaded the necessity of rendering an
account for what he had done in his first consulship
contrary to the auspices and the laws, and regardless of
vetoes; for Marcus Cato often declared, and took oath too,
that he would impeach Caesar the moment he had
disbanded his army. It was openly said too that if he was
out of office on his return, he would be obliged, like Milo, to
make his defence in a court hedged about by armed men.
The latter opinion is the more credible one in view of the
assertion of Asinius Pollio, that when Caesar at the battle of
Pharsalus saw his enemies slain or in flight, he said, word
for word: ‘They would have it so. Even I, Gaius Caesar,
after so many great deeds, should have been found guilty,
if I had not turned to my army for help.’

Annals
Tacitus, 6.13.1-2
‘The excessive price of corn all but ended in rioting;
and large demands were for several days made in
the theatre with a freedom not usually employed
towards the sovereign.
Aroused by this, he (Tiberius) upbraided the
magistrates and the senate for having failed to
restrain the populace by the authority of the state;
and, in addition, pointed to the provinces from
which he imported the corn-supply, and to the fact
that he did so on a far greater scale than
Augustus.’

Claudius
Suetonius, 18
‘When there was a scarcity of grain because of
long-continued droughts, he (Claudius) was once
stopped in the middle of the Forum by a mob and
so pelted with abuse and at the same time with
pieces of bread, that he was barely able to make
his escape to the Palace by a back door; and after
this experience he resorted to every possible
means to bring grain to Rome, even in the winter
season. To the merchants, he held out the
certainty of profit by assuming the expense of any
loss that they might suffer from storms, and offered
to those who would build merchant ships large
bounties...’

Latin text by Maximilian Ihem. This material is in the public domain.

Annals
Tacitus, 14.60
The measure led to general and undisguised protests from the
common people, endowed with less discretion than their superiors, and –
thanks to their humble station – faced by fewer perils. Then came a
rumour that Nero had repented of his outrage and recalled Octavia to his
side.
At once exulting crowds scaled the Capitol, and Heaven at last
found itself blessed. They hurled down the effigies of Poppaea, they
carried the statues of Octavia shoulder-high, strewed them with flowers,
upraised them in the Forum and the temples. Even the emperor’s praises
were essayed with vociferous loyalty. Already they were filling the Palace
itself with their numbers and their cheers, when bands of soldiers
emerged and scattered them in disorder with whipcuts and levelled
weapons. All the changes effected by the outbreak were rectified, and the
honours of Poppaea reinstated.
Tacitus: The Annals. Translated by J. Jackson. This material is in the public domain.
9

Annals
Tacitus, 14.42-5
‘…the rapid assembly of populace, bent on protecting so
many innocent lives, brought matters to the point of sedition,
and the senate house was besieged…’
‘While no one member ventured to controvert the opinion of
Cassius, he was answered by a din of voices, expressing pity
for the numbers, the age, or the sex of the victims, and for
the undoubted innocence of the majority. In spite of all, the
party advocating execution prevailed; but the decision could
not be complied with, as a dense crowd gathered and
threatened to resort to stones and firebrands. The Caesar
then reprimanded the populace by edict, and lined the whole
length of road, by which the condemned were being marched
to punishment, with detachments of soldiers.’

Elements of History
Fronto, 17
(mid-2nd century AD)
It was the height of political wisdom for the emperor not
to neglect even actors and the other performers of the stage,
the circus, and the arena, since he knew that the Roman
people is held fast by two things above all, the grain supply
and the shows, that the success of the government depends
on amusements as much as on serious things. Neglect of
serious matters entails the greater detriment, neglect of
amusements the greater unpopularity. The money largesses
(congiaria) are less eagerly desired than the shows; the
largesses appease only the grain-doled plebs singly and
individually, while the shows keep the whole population happy.

"The Neolithic Revolution
• Domestication, settlement, agriculture
• Limited range
• Persistence as part of hybrid “many worlds”
(dates?)
• The question of progress
• The subsequent organization of agriculture‐
based states

The industrial revolution
• Organization of labor
• Reliance on fossil fuels
• Vast increase in productivity

The still unnamed revolution we are
living through:
“Information” is part but not the whole
Also geographical consolidation and concerns
Mumford: an artificial, human‐built world?

Types of revolution:
• Physical, scientific use (earth around sun)
• Political metaphor (French, Russian, etc.)
• Technological metaphor (industrial, Second
Industrial, information, etc.)
• Things accumulate: displacements are gradual
and often incomplete

Social teleology:
Where do we come from?
Where are we going?
What does it all mean?
What is our place in the universe?
What really matters?

Paul Gauguin, “Where Do We Come
From? What are We? Where are We
Going?” (1897)
(Boston Museum of Fine Arts)
This image is public domain

Revolutions in ends as well as means
• Question of ends is always there
• Another energy source: psychic and social
energy, enlisting allegiance and trust
• Meanings in kinship, rulers, nation, wealth
• Is this also changing? Is “sustainability” a new
end? others?

Four revolutions changing the role of
“technology in history”
• The Human Revolution in “prehistory” or
paleohistory
• The Neolithic Revolution
• The Industrial Revolution
• The Human Empire

Key points about the human
revolution
• Startling and shocking discovery of
“prehistory,” which is also history (dates?)
• The primary event: emergence of humans as
distinct from the rest of nature, while also
being part of nature
• A view of “technology in history” beyond tool‐
making for physical survival

Cave art as part of socio‐technological
system
• Quest for meaning: human place and purpose
in the rest of nature
• Providing a social meeting point to swap
observations, reaffirm bonds, learn more
about animals, arrange for cooperation,
sharing of food
• Mithen: “…a tool for survival, one as essential
as tools of stone, clothes of fur, and the fires
that crackled within the caves”

The end of a way of life

woodlands, scattered animals, less need for
group hunts
• 20000+ years
• What other ways of life are extinct?

Mithen on the end of cave art:
“The cessation of cave painting is a remarkable

"STS.007 Reading Notes for Class 1
(On Leo Marx, “Technology: The Emergence of a Hazardous Concept”)
In the first part of the essay, L. Marx explains the fundamental anachronism of the word and
concept technology. Make sure you understand this basic point: the word is used to describe
“something” that allegedly is a central driver of human history back to the so-called Stone Age,
but the word itself emerged only in very recent times.
What is L. Marx’s problem with the capsule history he describes as being the conventional view
of the role of technology in history? Do you agree that this represents a conventional brief
history of technology? (562)
When did the word become popular in common usage? (562)
How is the emergence of word an historical event? (562-3)
What is a “semantic void”? (563)
What are some other, older words displaced by the growing use of the word technology? (563)
How can a word be said to be “hazardous”? (564)
In the second and third parts of the essay, L. Marx discusses two sets of reasons for the
emergence of technology as a key word in the U.S.
In the second part: what are “ideological” reasons he cites? (564-67)
What is the idea of progress? How is this a theory of history? (564-65)
How did radical thinkers of the l8th century think of the relationship between mechanical and
political progress? (565)
How was the relationship between means and ends thought about differently by the “new
entrepreneurial elite” of the l9th century? (566)
How did some dissidents of the l9th century challenge this prevailing understanding of means
and ends? (566-67)
Is the ideology of progress dominant at MIT today? If so, give some examples. If not, give some
examples.
In the third part: what are some “substantive” material reasons for the emergence of technology
as a key word in the 20th century? (567)
What is a complex sociotechnological system? (567) Can you think of other examples of such
systems besides the ones L. Marx cites?
How and when did the word technology began to be used more widely? How was its meaning
different from the prevailing meaning today? (569-70)
What do you learn about the naming of MIT? (570)

Did Karl Marx play an important role in popularizing technology? Read carefully K. Marx’s
definition of the term in Capital. (570) Do you think it is adequate? Illuminating?
What is the Second Industrial Revolution? (For that matter, what is the first Industrial
Revolution?) (571)
Who are some social scientists and other writers who introduced technology into more common
usage? (572)
In the last part of the essay. L. Marx summarizes his case that technology may be a hazardous
concept. He begins by returning to the concept of a “semantic void.” Make sure you understand
what this is. (573)
What is paralypsis? (573)
What are some reasons L. Marx gives for the popularity of the word and concept technology in
the 20th and now the 21st century? What unfortunate associations does it leave behind, in contrast
to older terms? (573-74)
How does the word technology blur the boundary between material and non-material
(bureaucratic, ideological) components of a sociotechnological system? Where is the boundary
between technology and the rest of society and culture? (574-75)
Is this expansive character part of what makes technology “hazardous”?
What does it mean to attribute historical agency to technology? What is reification? (576)
How is it hazardous to attribute technology with the power of historical agency? What are some
other possible sources of “agency” in history? (576-77)
Summarize the reasons why L. Marx concludes that technology is a hazardous concept.

them…He persuaded the, reconciled them, and won them

For those opposing forces which, as in a vessel,

one, thereby giving to faction an irresistible momentum that
overpowered and overthrew everything. At all events, Cato,
when men said that the state had been overturned by the

Pompey, declared that they wrongly laid the blame on what
merely happened last; for it was not their discord nor yet
their enmity, but their concord and harmony which was the

The Civil War
Caesar, 1.7
‘‘They have seduced Pompey and led him astray, through jealous
belittling of my merits; and yet I have always supported Pompey, and
helped him to secure advancement and reputation. A precedent has been
created in government; in the recent past, armed force restored the
tribunes’ veto; now armed force is repressing and overriding it…The
decree calling upon the magistrates to act to save the State from
harm…was never passed before now except in the case of pernicious
legislation, or violence by tribunes, or a mutiny of the people, when the
temples and heights commanding the city were seized; and these earlier
precedents were atoned for by the fates of Saturninus and the Gracchi.
But in the present instance, none of these things has taken place, or even
been contemplated; there has been no law proposed, no attempt to
appeal to the people, no mutiny.
I have been your commander for nine years; under my
leadership, your efforts on Rome’s behalf have been crowned with good
fortune; you have won countless battles and have pacified the whole of
Gaul and Germany. Now, I ask you to defend my reputation (existimatio)
and standing (dignitas) against the assaults of my enemies.’

Julius
Suetonius, 30
[Caesar intended] to resort to war if the senate took
any drastic action against the tribunes of the
commons who interposed vetoes in his behalf. Now
this was his excuse for the civil war, but it is believed
that he had other motives. Gnaeus Pompeius used to
declare that since Caesar’s own means were not
sufficient to complete the works which he had
planned, nor to do all that he had led the people to
expect on his return, he desired a state of general
unrest and turmoil…
18

Others say that he dreaded the necessity of rendering an
account for what he had done in his first consulship
contrary to the auspices and the laws, and regardless of
vetoes; for Marcus Cato often declared, and took oath too,
that he would impeach Caesar the moment he had
disbanded his army. It was openly said too that if he was
out of office on his return, he would be obliged, like Milo, to
make his defence in a court hedged about by armed men.
The latter opinion is the more credible one in view of the
assertion of Asinius Pollio, that when Caesar at the battle of
Pharsalus saw his enemies slain or in flight, he said, word
for word: ‘They would have it so. Even I, Gaius Caesar,
after so many great deeds, should have been found guilty,
if I had not turned to my army for help.’

"City-States and Alliances in Ancient Greece.
Underlying Reasons of Their Existence and Their Consequences
Panayiotis P. Mavrommatis
Dec 8, 2004
Introduction
The ancient Greek world was much troubled and influenced by politics. While
other peoples settled to a single form of government, the Greeks were strungling
between monarchy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny; and while other peoples
were forming empires, the Greek cities usually preferred independence,in the form
of a polis, a city-state, and other times preferred to (or were forced to) join some
alliances, symmachies. Apart from the several differences that the several cities
had, which was one of the reasons why they might wish to stay independent, a
number of other reasons did not favor the formation of alliances, leagues, confed­
eracies or empires. On the other hand, Greek cities shared a lot in common, and
many other factors did favor the formation of alliances.
After a short review of the Greek cities and alliances formed from the Trojan war
to the years of Alexander the Great, we explore the reasons whya Greek city would
like to join a coallition or would prefer to stay independent. Finally, we present
some of the consequences of the two different levels of authority, and present a
connection between the ancienpt oleis with modern nations, and between ancient
coallitions with modern ones.
1

City-states and alliances in Ancient Greece
Before the Trojan War, there is little account for Greek alliances; as Thucydides
mentions [Thu, 1.III]: “... Before the Trojan war there is no indication of anycommon
action in Hellas, nor indeed of the universal prevalence of the name; ... It was not
till Hellen and his sons grew strong in Phthiotis, and were invited as allies into the
other cities, that one by one they gradually acquired from the connection the name
of Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon
all. ”
Homer provides us with the earliest accounts for the various city-states of main­
land Greece in the Iliad. Book 2? lists the composition of the Greek army in Troy,
with over ? cities, all independent and ruled bybthaesiirl eis. The expedition to Troy,
however, also constitutes an early example of an alliance formepdo lebiys, with the
participating armies recognizing Agamemnon, ruler of Argos, as their leader[?, ?].
Moving on to later years and away from an expedition whose reasons and even
existence severalcommentators have questioned, an important, as it provedfor the
future of Greeks, alliance was formed towards the ?when?, the “Hellenic League”.
Originating from the Peloponnesian League but also including Athens and other
Greek cities, the Hellenic League successfully repelled the Persians from mainland
Greece. Herodotus lists the cities that participated in the league both in the battle
of Salamis and in that of Plataea. Another alliance was also present in these
battles, however: At the battle of Plataea, Thebes, Boeotia, Thessalia, Macedonia
and Thessaly fought on the Persian side [Her20, 8,9].
After the success against the Persians, Sparta withdrew from the Hellenic League
and reformed the Peloponnesian League. Athens took advantage of its contribu­
tion to the success of the Persian wars and of its naval dominance, and given
the still existent barbarian danger leds yam machia, which soon turned out to be
an empire, the Delian League. As Thucydides describes, several cities voluntar­
ily joined Athens which decided how many ships and how much money each city
would contribute against the barbarian danger [Thu, 1.XCVI].
2

Soon the two alliances confronted each other. In the Peloponnesian War, the
greatest war until then, according to Thucydides, [Thu, 1.I], Sparta, with most of
Peloponnese, Megarians, Locrians, Boeotians, Phocians, Ambraciots, Leucadians,
and Anactorians, faced Athens, with the Chians, Lesbians, Plateans, the Messe­
nians in Naupactus, most of the Acarnanians, the Corcyraeans, Zacynthians and
some others as well [Thu, 2.IX].
After the fall of Athens in 4B0.4C . , Sparta began expanding to “all four points
of the compass” [Hor02, p.212], leading to the creation of a second Athenian con­
federacy. Thebes was the one who stopped Sparta’s dominance this time, with the
battle at Leuctra[?, ?].
Philip’s rise in Macedonia lead to another alliance among Thebes, Sparta, Athens
and other cities that resisted the idea of Philip’s expansion to the south. The battle
of Chaeronea in 33B8 .C. marks the end of the Greek city-state, with the exception
of some cities such as Athens that survived until later. Without traditional city-
states, the leagues created from then on were no longer the same either. Greek
cities were merged in the Macedonian empire, and in other empires that followed
the death of Alexander.
Reasons for independent city-states
The most obvious reason why city-states chose to remain independent is the dif­
ferences that the various city-states had. In terms of form of government, Athens
and a number of cities that imitated her were democratic [Her20, 2.XXXVII], while
most of the other cities had either an oligarchy, tyranny or aristocracy. Social class
was also a point of difference amopnogl eis. Sparta, for example, had a unique
classification with Helots, Perioikoi and Spartiates sharing different citizen privi­
leges, while in democratic cities the citizens usually shared equal privileges. Ed­
ucation was mostly about philosophy and arts in Athens, and solely military in
Sparta. Some cities had restrictions in trading with other cities, while others were
economically dependent mostly on trading. The position of women, although gen­
erally unacceptable, was also different amonpgo leis. All these differences made
the existence of independenpto leis reasonable.
3

Aside from the obvious differences among the city-states, for several cities, es­
pecially for powerful ones, joining an alliance might mean losing their dominance.
In many cases, for example, disputes arose as to who should lead the alliance
and take decisions, and whether the others should obey someone who they might
consider inferior or at least not superior. Homer begins the Iliad with such a dis­
pute, among Achilles and Agamemnon[?, 1.?]. Later on, during the Persian Wars,
the Peloponnesians and the Athenians disputed about the location of the league’s
naval fight with the Persians. The former were proposing the Isthmus of Corinth,
while the Athenians led by Themistocles insisted on Salamis, which would prevent
the Persians from reaching Athens [Her20, 1.?]. City-specific or even personal
interests, therefore, several times acted as barriers in creating alliances.
Another fact that keppt oleis from joining alliances was that often a single mem­
ber of the alliance would act imperialistically and abuse the resources of the other
members. There are plenty examples of such actions throughout the ancient
Greek history. The earliest example is probably in the Iliad, where Agamemnon
took Achilles’ girl because he had to return his own to her father [?, 1.?]. Athens,
centuries later, treated their allies as subjects and not as equals; as Thucydides
mentions, “Athens, on the contrary, had by degrees deprived hers of their ships,
and imposed instead contributions in money on all except Chios and Lesbos. Both
found their resources for this war separately to exceed the sum of their strength
when the alliance flourished intact” [Thu, 1.XIX]. Similar behavior was engaged by
Philip and Alexander. The “allies” had to contribute in terms of men and arms,
or else pay a heavy fine [Fer01, p.18]. Thus, imperialistic behavior, which was not
infrequent in the ancient Greek history, acted as another barrier in joining alliances.
Moreover, the possibility of losing the city’s distinctive identity, and the unwilling­
ness to share a city’s historyand pride constitute some more reasons top owlhisy a
might rather stay out of an alliance. Sparta, for example, by constitution did not al­
low the mingling with other Greeks, in fear of its people questioning whether their
constitution and way of living was the best they could have. Athens made an effort
to unite the various city-states in the era of its empire. These efforts, however, did
not include political rights (citizenship) to men of other cities. Athenians, on the one
hand, did not wish to share the advantages of being Athenian, and the other cities
4

feared of “at least partial loss of identity”[Fer01, p.19]. At this point we could also
mention that Sparta, which, being special (in the sense of completely different) had
another reason against forming an alliance, namely the Helots. An alliance usually
meant expeditions, but Sparta could not afford them in fear of the Helot population’s
revolving. The loss of identity, therefore, the unwillingness to share political rights
and the dependency of some cities on slaves constituted some further reasons
against the formation of alliances.
A final reason why city-states remained mostly independent was the existence
of tyranny in many of the Greek cities. As Thucydides reports, “ wherever there
were tyrants, their habit of providing simply for themselves, of looking solely to
their personal comfort and family aggrandizement, made safety the great aim of
their policy, and prevented anything great proceeding from them” [Thu, 1.XVII].
History provides many examples of tyrants, most of which remained monarchs for
a relatively small period of time, were usually detested by their people and rarely,if
ever, did their descendants inherit their power. Osborne explains how the tradition
of the “bad tyrant” evolved, and how most of the tyrants were busy eliminating
the members of the elite that opposed them [Osb96, pp.192-6]. Even in cases
where the tyrants were considered “good”, this might have been due to their efforts
to show some public work which turned the people’s attention away from politics,
as in the case of the Peisistratids [Osb96, p. 285]. No matter what the people’s
opinion about the tyrants was, therefore, their existence most of the times proved
another obstacle in any effort to unity.
Reasons for alliances
On the other hand, as we have seen in page 2, alliances between the Greek
city-states were not at all infrequent. A number of reasons that motivated the for­
mation of such alliances can be traced throughout the History, the most obvious
one being the common elements that the Greek cities shared. What distinguished
Greeks from non-Greeks was their language, which was common among Greek
city-states in most parts, maybe in several dialects. Greek tradition was also com­
mon for the cities, and Greek mythology was usually shared among them. Religion
and moral beliefs were also very similar, given the belief to the Olympian Gods and
5

the frequent visits to their representatives at Delphi, for example. Archaeological
evidence enriches our list with architecture and art; Greek cities were influenced
by each other’s patterns. Finally, many of tphoele is were founded by others and
therefore felt “blood bonds” with their founding cities[?]. All these common ele­
ments, therefore, that distinguished Greeks from non-Greeks, were a significant
motive for the formation of alliances.
A second cause for alliances was the defense against the Persian danger. The
formation of the Hellenic League when the Persians started moving towards main­
land Greece was an early example; with the league consisting of many Greek city-
states defending themselves in Marathon, Salamis and Plataea. As soon as the
Persian threat was miles away from mainland Greece, the league broke up, thus
making clear the reasons of its formation. The Delian League, formed soon after
was also formed for this reason. Thucydides states “The Athenians ... fixed which
cities were to contribute money against the barbarian, which ships; their professed
object being to retaliate for their sufferings by ravaging the [Persian] king’s coun­
try.” [Thu, 1.XCVI]. Thus, even though as it turned out in the end, the Athenians
turned the alliance into an empire, the barbarian danger was a significant cause
for the formation of alliances.
A further reason to the formation of an alliance was to defend from, or attack to,
another existing alliance. There were two examples of such a behavior. First,
Herodotus informs us about the fears of Sparta: “If the Athenians are not our
friends, but league themselves with the barbarians, however strong our wall across
the Isthmus may be, there will be doors enough, and wide enough open too, by
which the Persian may gain entrance to the Peloponnese” [Her, 9.IX]. These fears
contributed to Sparta’s decision to join the other forces against the Persians. The
second example is Thucydides’ view of the true reasons of the Peloponnesian
War. According to the Greek historian, the real cause for the war was the growing
power of Athens and its alliance (or empire), and the ”alarm which this inspired
in Lacedaemon” [Thu, 1.XXII]. Sparta’s action was then to (re)form the Pelopon­
nesian League and after some events (the “immediate causes”) declare war with
Athens. The existence of alliances, therefore, which might gain power and threaten
other city-states, was another cause for the creation of even more alliances.
6

Another reason for joining an alliance was the inability to stay independent, es­
pecially in the case of existing and powerful alliances or empires were having a
war with each other. During the Persian Wars, for example, as Herodotus writes,
almost all the city-states were forced to join one alliance (the Persian one) or the
other (the Hellenic League); and those who chose the Persian one were not few,
since it was certainly more powerful and its success was more probable. The case
where a city-state might want to exit an alliance was similar. To do so, they usu­
ally had to ask for the help of another alliance. During the Peloponnesian War,
Mytilene attempted to revolt and asked from Sparta and its allies their help [Thu,
3.IX]. Thucydides provides the Mytilenean justification for their revolt: “How then
could we put our trust in such friendship or freedom as we had here? We accepted
each other against our inclination; fear made them court us in war, and us them
in peace; sympathy, the ordinary basis of confidence, had its place supplied by
terror, fear having more share than friendship in detaining us in the alliance” [Thu,
3.XII]. Either with the Greco-Persian War, therefore, or with the Peloponnesian war,
Greek poleis had to choose between one alliance or another.
Consequences of independent city-states
The existence of city-states in Greece that were autonomous and independent
had a number of consequences for the subsequent history of the Greek world and
the world in general. The first positive consequence is the rise of democracy in
Athens. The constitution of Athens, as developed by Solon and later improved by
Cleisthenes and Pericles [Plu48, p. 449-59], included many elements considered
democratic today; the major difference being that it only applied to male citizens.
Without autonomy and independence, under an empire or a kingdom, for example,
it is hard to imagine that a city-state could develop a democratic constitution. First,
the emperor(s)/king would not like the idea at all, and second, it would be infeasible
to apply. Given the lack of technological advances of modern society, implemented
a nation-wide democracy would be very hard, given the “absolute” character of it,
i.e. all the people deciding in public gatherings. The rise of Athenian democracy,
therefore, is an important consequence of thpeol is.
7

The independence of everycity also gave rise to a Greek “war machine”, Sparta.
Sparta’s distinctive identity in education, constitution, way of life and war is evi­
dent from many accounts as well as archaeological findings [Osb96, p.180]. Once
again, it is hard to believe that many other cities could have adopted the Lykourgan
constitution; especially given their lack of some kind of Helot population, that was
present in Sparta and suppor ted the existence of the whole Spartan system. This
system, however, proved essential in the battles of the Hellenic League against
the Persians. As Herodotus’ account shows [Her20, 1.LXV], the effectiveness of
Sparta in war was directly related to Lycourgos’ constitution and regulations. The
city-state system, therefore, gave the opportunity to “specialization” of a whole city
in the art of war and the successful confrontance of the Persian empire.
Finally, we can trace another important consequence ofp othlies system, the rich
flowering of the arts and sciences in Ancient Greece. A brief sampling of this de­
velopment would start from the monumental temples of tthh ec e5ntury B.C. Athens
but of almost every Greek city as well. Furthermore, we can trace architectural
sculpture, cult statues, pottery, as well as the Doric and the Ionic forms [Osb96,
pp. 259-71]. Other forms of art including the tragedy and the commedy, philos­
ophy, poetry and history itself are some further examples of the Greek cultural
inheritance. It should be recognized that such a cultural activity might also be
possible even if the city-states were not independent, however,p othlise system
did favor this development, given the competition among the cities, the democratic
government of some of them, etc.
On the other hand, however, there was at least one very important negative con­
sequence of the city-state system, and that was the collection of wars between the
various city-states themselves. With the Peloponnesian War being the longest and
the most devastating, examining the effects of this waris enough to see the degree
of this consequence. The political changes Sparta imposed on Athens and basi­
cally all Greekp oleis led to local hostilitiess,t aseis [Thu, 3.LXXXII]. The economy
of Athens declined dangerously, and her population dropped dramatically [Hor02,
pp.201-5]. All these demonstrate the adverse effects of the existence of indepen­
dent city-states and the competition that arose between them.

Consequences of alliances
What were the effects of alliances, however, whenever they formed? Once again,
both positive and negative consequences can be traced by the formation of al­
liances. The most important positive effect is probably the success against the
Persians.
• The economic rise of fifth century Athens and the rise of a strong navy. (as a
result of the Delian League)
Negative consequences:
• Imperialistic behavior (Athens’ expedition to Sicily, Sparta’s expedition to Asia
Minor as soon as the Peloponnesian War ended, Alexander’s expedition to
the South and the East)
Conclusions - Connection with present
The correspondence between
(a) City-state ←→ Modern nations
(b) Ancient Greek alliances← → Modern international alliances (e.g, EU)
in terms of having similar reasons for and against alliances.

"STS.464 :: The Intellectual History of Technology
The Context of Classical and Early Modern Philosophy
8 February 2005
Today in class
1. logistics, class list, &c.
2. writing assignments: discussion of what’s expected, reading two examples together to guide
the discussion
3. further discussion of reading
4. return to White Noise
5. preview of next week
The central question of this class
The history of Western culture is affected and conditioned bythe emergence of forces which called
forth the word “technology.” What is it that happened to human behavior that nevessitated this
word?
Some background on the study of “technology”
The term “technology” was first used by Jacob Bigelow (mid­1800s). Bigelow coined the term
to refer to the study of and treatises on the mechanic arts: the knowledge and literature on the
study of the mechanic arts. This is obviously quite different than the modern sense of the word.
“Technology” doesn’t really gain currency until around WWII.
The history of the word is not the same as the history of the concept; this course is a joint inquiry
into this question.
The social constructivist movement: emphasized that knowledge is socially constructed, not
just “discovered”
Bacon: knowledge provides the means for human domination of reality, the world
The human relationship to nature is the thing that really shifts.
Readings
Ethical underpinnings (e.g. the ancients), gendered dialogue (e.g. Bacon)
Hierarchies of knowledge: Bacon (Scharff & Dusek, pp. 26­27), Plato, Aristotle (Scharff &
Dusek, p.19)
Aristotle:
1. understanding
1

2. intelligence
3. scientific knowledge
4. craft knowledge (production not action)
−→ Between Aristotle and Bacon, we see something of a reversal of these hierarchies.
Where is “technology” in Plato & Aristotle?
• techne, logos, craft knowledge
• mathematics
• the dialectic −→ the method of finding knowledge
• pathways to betterment (though not material)
A bit on technological determinism
technological determinism: the idea that technology drives history
Raises some problems/quesions...
• Why does technology evolve?
• What are the dymanics of technological change?
• Is there a particular direction, evolution, or goal? The idea of “progress”
• What is the impetus of technological change?
• Who or what causes/drives change?
• Question of historical agency...
• Is the question of technological change different from change?
Technological determinism is something of a forbidden through in the history of technology. It
is illogical, as it ascribes agency to technology (rather than to humans), and it is immoral, as
it consequently abdicates responsibility. It takes agency away from humans and ascribes it to
machines which were created by humans.
HOWEVER: People often feel this way, like technology is running their lives. This feeling in and
of itself is important to consider.
−→ Issue of entrapment, of power: is technology deterministic for those who do not have a
hand in creating it?
−→ Is the abstraction what makes it deterministic/impenetrable?
−→ Just because humans create something, does it mean that humans have control over it?
(Passage from White Noise, for instance...)
Next week
The Enlightenment and the Belief in Progress

Readings from Henry Adams, Kant, Comte, and Rousseau
The Education of Henry Adams: a book about the effect of technology on him and his world.
• lifetime of learning about change
• acceleration of the rate of change
• 3 locations −→ 3 ways of being in the world
• fundamental irony around the word “failure” −→ he was a most successful man, so why
did he consider his “education” to be a failure?
• caught up in American imperialism
• “the law of unforeseen consequences”
• 20 years are missing in the middle: his marriage, his wife’s suicide

Augustus
Suetonius, 79
His expression, whether in conversation or
when he was silent, was so calm and mild that one
of the leading men of the Gallic provinces admitted
to his countrymen that it had softened his heart,
and kept him from carrying out his design of
pushing the emperor over a cliff, when he had been
allowed to approach him under the pretence of a
conference, as he was crossing the Alps.
He had clear, bright eyes, in which he liked
to have it thought that there was a kind of divine
power, and it greatly pleased him, whenever he
looked keenly at anyone, if he let his face fall as if
before the radiance of the sun.

Res Gestae
1-2
1 At the age of nineteen, on my own initiative and at my own
expense, I raised an army by means of which I restored
liberty to the republic, which had been oppressed by the
tyranny of a faction. For which service the senate, with
complimentary resolutions, enrolled me in its order, in the
consulship of Gaius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius, giving me at
the same time consular precedence in voting; it also gave me
the imperium. As propraetor it ordered me, along with the
consuls, “to see that the republic suffered no harm.” In the
same year, moreover, as both consuls had fallen in war, the
people elected me consul and a triumvir for setting the
constitution.
2 Those who slew my father I drove into exile, punishing their
deed by due process of law, and afterwards, when they
waged war upon the republic, I twice defeated them in
battle…

Reading from Greek and Roman Technology Sourcebook
1. Attitude - how much due to humans, how much to gods; five ages/metals
5th age of man: gold, silver, bronze, heroes, iron – opposite of progress - arguments
Raw metals: copper, silver, gold – axe of Ice Man of Alps was of native copper – source of trade
– needed bellows (200 BCE) needed to get metal hot enough to melt and cast
Used for axes, saw blades, knives, swords, armor – ordinary people used stone and wood
Copper works better when mixed with tin (soft: bronze (cooper to tin ten to one) – lower melting
point, not so brittle, kept an edge, easy to cast – tin not that common – used in mid east, N
Africa, Europe, China, in Americas from 500 on
2

Iron: much harder than bronze – needed more heat to smelt – wrought iron is brittle, doesn’t hold
an edge well – but much more iron ore around, much cheaper once blacksmiths learned how to
smelt it – much more efficient axes
Iron making reached india from Mesopotamia ca. 1000 BCE – axes – to China ca. 700 BCE –
transformed Africa – could cut down forests – Bantus –
By 4th c BCE iron swords could cut through bronze
Also from Greek and Roman Sourcebook: sources of energy – most of all animal, both human
(slaves, soldiers) and animals
Horses domesticated in 3rd millennium BCE – next millennium much lighter wheels – fast and
deadly chariots with two wheels, two horses, driver and archer – a real advantage
Then in 2nd millennium BCE, bigger horses, riding, cavalrymen – nomads invaded Egypt –
Assyrians armed infantry with iron swords and battering rams – long conflicts between settled
empires and nomadic herdsmen
with iron and horses and wheeled vehicles, an era of warfare – larger empires – richer, did a lot
of building – dependence of slave labor
1500 BCE to 500 CE the great age of construction – succession of empires in Europe, Mid East,
India, China– had rain, water, needed efficient methods of comm and trans

Parallel Lives – a Historical Lesson in Ethical Behavior
Plutarch, a Greek aristocrat and a writer by profession, was born in the middle of
first century AD. During his life he produced over two hundred separate titles that
focused mostly on moral issues. However, one of his major works, Parallel Lives,
provides the readers with biographies of Greek and Roman historical figures and is
largely based on information obtained from various historical documents, oral tradition,
and knowledgeable contemporaries of the author. Plutarch’s choice of material may lead
the readers to believe that the goal of Parallel Lives was to give an accurate historical
account of the lives of the famous statesmen and that the work can be safely used as a
historical source. A careful analysis of the text, however, reveals that in his biographies
such as those of Lycurgus and Solon, Plutarch focuses on character traits of the historical
figures and provides the readers with numerous stories containing moral lessons. This
suggests that his true purpose was not to provide an unbiased historical account of the
lives of the past leaders but to analyze the character of important Greek and Roman
historical figures and through real-life examples of their decisions that either lead to
success or to failure educate the leaders of his own time in ethical behavior (Plutarch
(Stadter Introduction), xi). Consequently, before using a particular piece of information
in Parallel Lives as a historical source, the readers should examine the context of its
presentation and assess the objectiveness of Plutarch. For example, Plutarch could have
invented events to support the character development of the historical figures, interpreted
an actual fact in a biased way that fit a particular trait he wanted to discuss, or presented
only those events that fit the personality he selected for his statesman.
Plutarch demonstrates his focus on the character of the historical figures through
open use of unreliable historical information for the sake of character development. For
example, at the beginning of Lycurgus’s biography, the author acknowledges that “there
is nothing indisputable to be said about Lycurgus the legislator” and yet, he proceeds to
examine his life, unsure about when the man lived, who his parents were, how he died,
and even if he were just one man and not two (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 1). He writes about

Gorlin 2
Lycurgus because he could be credited with creation of “an actual and unrivalled system
of government” that relies on “virtue and internal unanimity,” a system from which
Plutarch’s contemporaries could learn proper ethical behavior (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 31).
Later in the biography the author is “reluctant to attribute to Lycurgus a disgusting
institution like the krypteia” even though the ancient sources suggest that he was
responsible for its establishment (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 28). Plutarch bases “this judgment
of his character on his equitability and fairness in other respects” (Plutarch, Lycurgus,
28). Thus, in order to present the character of Lycurgus in a consistent way to his
readers, Plutarch picks out historical evidence that fits with Lycurgus’s “high-mindedness
and justice” and rejects other sources (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 3). Similarly, in his biography
of Solon, Plutarch includes an unreliable account of Solon’s encounter with Croesus. He
explains his decision by claiming that “when a story is so famous and well attested and,
more importantly, so much in keeping with Solon’s character and worthy of his self-
assurance” that a chronological inconsistency is not a good enough reason to reject it as
fiction (Plutarch, Solon, 27). Thus, in the biographies of Lycurgus and Solon, Plutarch is
more concerned with character development of his historical figures than the historical
accuracy of the information he presents.
Another clue that reveals the author’s focus on character development of
Lycurgus and Solon is his inclusion of stories from history interpreted in a way that they
highlight the moral values and personality traits of the historical figures and provide the
readers with valuable lessons. For example, in the first story told in Lycurgus’s
biography, Lycurgus is approached by his deceased brother’s wife who offers to kill her
unborn child, an heir to the throne, if Lycurgus marries her. Plutarch reports that
Lycurgus found the woman’s “immorality abhorrent” but went along with the idea until
the king was born and then saved the child by taking him away from his mother
(Plutarch, Lycurgus, 3). The author then points out that after this event, the people of
Sparta become “very impressed by his [Lycurgus’s] high-mindedness and justice”
(Plutarch, Lycurgus, 3). Consequently, this episode identifies the character of Lycurgus
and allows the readers to learn from a real-life problem that was resolved by Lycurgus in
a just manner. In another historical account, Lycurgus is chased out of the city square by
the rich Spartans who are unhappy with his reforms and is eventually struck by a young

Gorlin 3
Spartan Alcander who knocks out his eye. Lycurgus, however, still confronts the crowd
and is able to win it over. He then punishes Alcander by making him his servant with a
goal of changing him “from being an insubordinate, badly behaved young man to a very
well-mannered responsible adult” (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 11). Plutarch uses this story to
emphasize Lycurgus’s “self-possession and high-mindedness” and to present his readers
with another case study of a real-life problem and an appropriate solution (Plutarch,
Lycurgus, 11). In the concluding story of Lycurgus’s biography, Lycurgus obtains a
promise from the assembly of Spartans that they will live by his laws until he comes back
from Delphi. He then leaves Sparta and decides to kill himself, so “the state would
continue to be held in the highest honor” (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 29). Plutarch uses this
episode to highlight Lycurgus’s honorable qualities and “perfection of his happiness” in
death and to demonstrate to his readers that even death can be “an effective act of virtue”
(Plutarch, Lycurgus, 29). The idea of death as an act of virtue is also mentioned in the
biography of Solon, when Solon tells Croesus about some of the most happy men he
knows --Tellus and Cleobis and Biton brothers. “Tellus had been a man of integrity, with
distinguished sons to succeed him, who had lacked for none of life’s essentials while he
was alive and had died a glorious death winning the prize for valour in defence of his
homeland” (Plutarch, Solon, 27). Thus, like Lycurgus, he was able to die a happy man.
Cleobis and Biton brothers were highly devoted to each other and their mother, so when
their mother’s oxen was late they harnessed themselves instead and took her to the temple
of Hera. After they “had performed their sacrifices and drunk their wine, they went to
sleep and never got up in the morning, but were found to have capped their great glory
with an easy and painless death” (Plutarch, Solon, 27). Thus, the two brothers also died
happy and honorably. Consequently, these stories emphasize the wise character of Solon
and teach the readers that people should strive to live virtuous and honorable lives up
until they die, because they can only be considered happy and successful if they die
happy and successful. In another story in Solon’s biography, Plutarch describes an
assembly meeting during which Ariston suggests granting Pisistratus fifty club-bearers as
bodyguards. Solon, however, sees through Pisistratus’s plea for protection and
recognizes that he is attempting to gain power of the city. Consequently, he protests
Ariston’s motion and attempts to convince the people to not assist Pisistratus. However,

Gorlin 4
when he realizes that the poor will continue to support Pisistratus and the rich will not
speak against Pisistratus, he gives up and leaves the assembly, “remarking that he had
more intelligence that the one party and more courage than the other” (Plutarch, Solon,
30). This episode provides further evidence of Solon’s cleverness and honesty, but since
Solon gives up on the people, it presents the readers with a real-life problem but no
definitive solution. Thus, Plutarch’s stories had different kinds of lessons for his
audience; some stories had a suggested answer provided within them, while others
provoked the readers to think of their own solutions. As a group, they served to
emphasize the character of important historical figures and to educate the readers of
Parallel Lives.
Plutarch’s inclusion of stories and unreliable material to stress character
development has a great affect on the potential use of his work as a historical source.
Since historical accuracy is not his first priority, he could have transferred some of the
characteristics of Lycurgus’s and Solon’s Roman counterparts onto them in order to make
the character comparisons between the two lives easier. He could have also invented
certain events to support his points and left out events that failed to support his points.
For example, in Lycurgus’s biography Plutarch supplies the readers with such random
details as “they [Spartans] remembered something Lycurgus had said about long hair –
that it increases the attractiveness of handsome men and the fearsomeness of ugly men”
(Plutarch, Lycurgus, 22). This detail works well with Plutarch’s portrayal of Lycurgus as
an intelligent ruler but it is unclear how Plutarch would know that Lycurgus used to say
this. Therefore, it is likely that he is attributing common Lacedaemonian sayings to
Lycurgus. Similarly, in Solon’s biography, the author includes a conversation between
Solon and Thespis, a play writer, in which Solon asks “Aren’t you ashamed to tell such
enormous lies in front of so many people?” (Plutarch, Solon, 29) This episode is
consistent with Solon’s honest character and Plutarch uses it to emphasize Solon’s
disposition to truth. However, it is again uncertain how Plutarch would collect such
information and therefore, it is likely that the story was fabricated. Besides adding
questionable and possibly invented stories, Plutarch probably leaves out contradicting
information from his analysis of the historical figures. For example, the institution of
krypteia plays no role in his character development of Lycurgus, but since the institution

Gorlin 5
was well-known Plutarch briefly mentions it in his text with an explanation of why he
does not think it applies to Lycurgus. However, Plutarch could have been aware of other
less famous details that also contradicted his analysis but have chosen not to include them
in his work. Consequently, Plutarch’s account of events is probably incomplete since it
contains only those events which support the character development of his historical
figures. Thus, Plutarch’s text should not be completely trusted as historically correct
even in relation to the character and contributions of the historical figures.
Another problem with Plutarch’s focus on character development and not
historical accuracy is his subjective interpretation of the historical sources. For example,
to be able to compare the society created by Lycurgus to Plato’s ideal systems, he
describes all of the unorthodox Spartan practices in a positive light. Plutarch mentions
how Spartan boys were taught “to be teased without getting annoyed” and claims that this
resulted in a formation of a “particular feature of Laconian character: the ability to take a
joke” (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 12). However, his reason behind inclusion of this supposedly
positive characteristic is probably justification of a Laconian custom “to… condemn what
was disgraceful” during assembly meetings (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 25). Although the
author claims that the criticism was performed “in an easy and jocular manner” and was
taken well by those criticized, one can speculate that he is not providing his audience
with an objective interpretation of the custom (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 25). The experience
could have been embarrassing and those criticized certainly could have become annoyed
with the constant teasing they had to tolerate. In a different interpretation of the custom,
Stadter claims that some Spartans committed suicide because of the social pressure put
onto them by the assembly (Plutarch (Stadter Notes), 390). Another unusual custom that
Plutarch discusses is boys sustaining themselves by stealing food from people’s gardens.
He interprets this as a learning experience that develops “their…bravery and cunning”
but it could also be interpreted as savage and immoral conduct (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 17).
Aristotle, for example, thought that Lycurgus turned boys into animals (Plutarch (Stadter
Notes), 388). Thus, to support his argument of Lycurgus as a ruler who created “an
actual and unrivalled system of government” based on virtue and internal unanimity,
Plutarch had to interpret all the parts of the social system in a positive way (Plutarch,
Lycurgus, 31). Consequently, these interpretations should be examined carefully and not

Gorlin 6
necessarily trusted as the reality of the Spartan social system. Plutarch also subjectively
interprets Solon’s laws to support Solon’s wise and just character. For example, as a
result of Solon’s reforms, the common people “could attend the Assembly and act as
jurors” (Plutarch, Solon, 18). This granted them power to resolve most disputes.
Plutarch also suggests that Solon could have purposely written his laws “obscurely and
ambiguously…so that they in a way were the masters of the laws” (Plutarch, Solon, 18).
Plutarch seems to borrow these ideas from Aristotle but he does not include the last part
of Aristotle’s argument that “it is not likely that he was unclear for that reason, but rather
because it is impossible to define what is best in general terms” (AthPol, 9). Thus,
Plutarch wants to portray Solon as a wise and foreseeing ruler, who gave the people
ultimate power and gives him too much credit. Consequently, one should approach
Plutarch’s arguments in the biographies carefully to make sure that they were not
interpreted in a biased or misleading way to support the established character of a
historical figure.
Thus, Plutarch’s biographies in Parallel Lives should be primarily treated as
lessons in ethical behavior and not as historical sources. They focus on the character of
the past historical figures, and they aim to educate the leaders of Plutarch’s time in ethical
behavior. However, Plutarch’s work could also be used as a historical source, if
historical evidence is extracted through careful examination of the text and identification
of possible biases, omissions, and fabrications."

Hesiod’s Moral Teachings on Living
In Hesiod’s poem “Works and Days”, he explains to his brother how to live a
good life. He describes both moral and practical ways of leading life. However,
his emphasis lies on the moral teachings rather than the practical ones. One of
the overarching themes of his work is the importance of being just in life. Hesiod
believes that Zeus and the other almighty immortal Gods punish immoral men
and reward moral ones. Therefore, men must not be unjust or unkind to one
another.
Some of his teachings are clearly moral For example, he mentions the
importance of treating one’s parents well multiple times in the poem. Hesiod’s
obsession with justice and morality can be inferred from this importance that he
places on taking care of ones parents. To him, being disrespectful to ones aging
parents is unjust and unfair because parents take care of their children when the
children are young and unable to take care of themselves. Thus it is only fair and
just to the parents that the children take care of them when they are too old to
fend for themselves.
Hesiod believes that it is not only justice that Zeus asks of people. He describes
other criminal acts that he believes will make Zeus angry. He mentions
wickedness, violence, seizing someone else’s property, being ungracious to a
guest, adultery and cheating orphans as examples of other crimes that warrant
Zeus’ wrath. “But for those who occupy themselves with violence and
wickedness and brutal deeds, Kronos’ son, wide-seeing Zeus, marks out
retribution. …From heaven, Kronos’ son brings disaster upon them, famine and

2
with it plague, and the people waste away. … ” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp.
44). Most of these transgressions have one thing in common – they are unjust
towards other people. For example, a man who commits adultery is being unjust
to his wife, while one who seizes someone else’s property is being unjust to the
rightful owner of the property. Thus we see that Hesiod is very concerned with
justice and righteousness and believes that Zeus harshly punishes anyone who
does injustice to another person.
A third moral teaching Hesiod provides in “Works and Days” is that cheating, that
is getting something by means other than hard work, is immoral; hence men
must refrain from cheating. He narrates a mythical story to make his audience
understand the consequences of cheating. He describes the story of Pandora:
Prometheus cheated the Gods, and as a penalty, the Gods seized fire from
earth. Prometheus further wronged the Gods by stealing fire back from Olympus.
As a punishment for this heinous crime, the God’s created a charming woman,
Pandora, and sent her to earth along with a jar full of trouble. Once Pandora
unleashed the trouble, it not only afflicted the criminal Prometheus, but also
brought trouble on the rest of mankind. Through this example, Hesiod is trying to
teach his audience how cheating and unjust behavior have grave penalties not
only for the rogue, but also for his entire society. Here, Hesiod draws an implicit
parallelism between Prometheus and Perses, who cheated Hesiod out of his fair
share of inheritance. Hesiod is warning Perses that he will have to suffer for
cheating Hesiod out of his inheritance. Hesiod also warns the local chiefs who
allowed Perses to get away with conning Hesiod “lords … keep your
pronouncement straight, you bribe swallowers, and forget your crooked judgment
altogether…. The eyes of Zeus, that sees everything and notices everything …”
(Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 44, 45). Thus, through the story of Pandora,
Hesiod is asking his fellow citizens and his brother to become honest and moral.
In the poem, Hesiod provides a detailed account of how to honor and respect
Zeus and the other Gods, which is definitely a form of moral teaching. He says

3
“Make sacrifice to the immortal gods …” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 47). He
also says “Never pour gleaming wine to Zeus in the morning with unwashed
hands, or to other immortals …” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 58). According to
him, the consequence of not honoring the immortal Gods is self-destruction. He
cites the example of the silver race of men who were “put away by Zeus son of
Kronos, angry because they did not offer honor to the blessed gods who occupy
Olympus” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 41).
Hesiod’s teachings described above are undoubtedly moral. But some of his
moral teachings appear practical on the surface. A deeper analysis of such
ostensibly practical teachings shows that they are, in fact, fundamentally moral.
For example, he asks Perses always to keep two ploughs at the farm. The moral
reason behind this seemingly practical advice is that Hesiod believes humans are
powerless and they should be continually prepared to fend off minor misfortunes
that Gods may throw in their way. Thus, having two ploughs is necessary
because Zeus might want to destroy one. Similarly, he asks Perses to build the
huts for his laborers in summer because Zeus may change the weather to winter
sooner than expected and the laborers will then need the huts to survive. These
practical advices are therefore given in the moral context of Hesiod’s belief that
humans are as helpless in the hands of Gods as puppets are in the hands of a
puppeteer, and the best a human can do to survive a God’s whims is to prepare
as much as possible.
To illustrate this powerlessness of humans, Hesiod narrates the story of a little
nightingale in the talons of a hawk. The hawk says to the nightingale “You are in
the power of one much superior, and you will go whichever way I take you…. He
is a fool who seeks to compete against the stronger. He both loses the struggle
and suffers injury on top of insult” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 43). Here, the
hawk in the fable is a metaphor for the omnipotent Gods, and the nightingale
stands for weak humans. To prove the powerlessness of humans, he also
describes how absolutely powerful the Gods are. “Because of him [Zeus] mortal

4
men are unmentioned and mentioned, spoken and unspoken of, according to
great Zeus’ will. For easily he makes strong, and easily he oppresses the strong
… ” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 37).
A second seemingly practical teaching that has a moral basis underneath is
Hesiod’s advice to Perses about working hard. On several occasions Hesiod
tells Perses that he must be diligent in his work. He even tries to motivate Perses
to work hard by telling him that only industry can make him wealthy and “wealth
brings worth and prestige” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 46). Hesiod’s moral
reason for asking Perses to be industrious is not to make him wealthy. Rather he
wants the Gods to be pleased with Perses as “Gods and men disapprove of men
who live without working” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 46).
Another moral teaching obscured by the façade of practicality is the calendar of
favorable dates that Hesiod presents at the end of the poem “Works and Days”.
He advises his audience to keep track of these dates “Pay due attention to the
days which comes from Zeus …” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 59). Even
though the calendar describes days for performing practical tasks, Hesiod
provides it to its audience for a moral reason. Because Hesiod believes that men
are powerless in the hands of the immortal Gods, he asks men to follow these
God given dates so that they can be successful in their endeavors. He says “Well
with god and fortune is he who works with knowledge of all this, giving the
immortals no cause for offence, judging the bird-omens and avoiding
transgression” (Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 59).
Why Hesiod dispenses moral teaching throughout his poem is clear. He believes
that Zeus destroys immoral races and rewards moral ones. He tells his audience
about the four races that Zeus destroyed because they were becoming
progressively more evil and violent. He warns his contemporary fellow Greek
citizens “Zeus will destroy this race [the race that Hesiod belongs to] of man also”
(Hesiod, Works and Days, pp. 42). As an incentive for being moral, Hesiod

5
describes Zeus’ prizes to just and righteous people. He says that if the people in
a community are just, their community will flourish and Zeus will prevent
calamities like famine and blight from affecting them. As a reward for their moral
behavior, Zeus will give these communities sufficient food, wealth and good
children, and make sure that they never need to go out in the dangerous seas.
To summarize, Hesiod’s moral teaching in “Works and Days” is that to lead a
good life it is extremely important that a man is just and righteous and that he
works hard to win his livelihood. But because men are powerless in the hand of
Gods, for his hard work to be successful, he must honor the all-powerful Gods by
partaking of actions on days that have been assigned for those actions. Lastly,
men must avoid every action that can offend the almighty Gods in Olympus.
Some of these advices are provided as moral teachings while some are
shrouded by an aura of practicality. But basically, most of his advices in “Works
and Days” have some sort of moral foundation. Therefore, Hesiod’s “Works and
Days” is mostly concerned with moral, rather than practical teaching."

Initial Discussion
• binary distinction of use/misuse of the term “technology”
• how do you define a “misuse”/“misusage”?
– verbal usage, meaning
– use for purposes
It is a misusage to apply the term “technology” anachronistically; however, the course is set up
anachronistically...
Intertwined nature of the terms technology and progress. They are closely bound in origins.
“Technology” as part of a constellation of terminology:
• knowledge
• power
• control
• comfort
• progress
• history
• science
• nature
History, science, technology −→ emerge almost as entities with trajectories, the “vast collective
projects”
−→ reification: ascribing agency to an abstraction
Discussion of technology is different in different languages.
The term “scientist” (a practitioner of science, as opposed to science itself) emerges, curiously
enough, around the same time as the term “technology.”
The Education of Henry Adams
Adams family −→ mercantile aristocracy
Henry Adams finds himself drawn to the Southern scene: pastoral, classical. Why is he drawn
to a slave culture? Didn’t like businessmen! Class issue, debate over manufactures = “State
Street”
1

Sees himself as outside, the other; outside the dualities to which he constantly alludes (Brooks
versus Adams, Boston versus Quincy, &c.)? Washington perhaps offers him a third path, apart
from (rejecting?) the Adams and Brooks sides.
Adams is full of this inner conflict. Continual use of this linguistic device: “—and yet...” Third
person voice creates an aesthetic distance, a nineteenth­century mood well­put by Matthew
Arnold as “wandering between two worlds: one dead, one waiting to be born.”
Relation between identity and place −→ Who am I as mapped against the world? Globalization...
The Debate over Manufactures
Morality and values woven into political/economic debate.
Where is “technology” in these readings?−→ factories, manufactures, industry, agriculture
Land and geography as they relate to technology, seeds of the “American character,” prefiguring
“frontier” discourse −→ technology as frontier. Speaks to an American discourse and aesthetic
that Tench Coxe understood.
Kant, Comte, and Rousseau
−→ technologies of production
−→ technologies of communication
−→ technologies of infrastructure
The Enlightenment −→ systems of communication and transportation. Highest value placed on
systems of thought.

"Hesiod's Works and Days: Moral or Practical Teaching?
Panayiotis P. Mavrommatis
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
21H.301 The Ancient World: Greece
Hesiod's Works and Days is undeniably a didactic poem. It is concerned
with real problems of mankind. At a first glance it may seem as a practical guide
to living and prospering in the Ancient Greek world. The title itself, along with the
many parts of the poem that deal with practical issues can lead one to this
conclusion. A more careful analysis, however, can show that Works and Days is
more about morality. Undeniably it also deals with the practice of morality, but the
main axis of the poem is not that; it is morality itself.
The first part of this paper attempts to present the abundance of moral
elements in the poem. The occasion of the poem is injustice, but Hesiod does not
stop there. He talks about war and peace, religion, family as well as society, all
crucial issues both then and now. In the second part, I argue against the view
that Works and Days is mostly a practical teaching poem. Instead, I trace the
importance of practical instruction in the poem as being support to Hesiod's main
teaching goal, morality.
Probably the most important issue for the poet is injustice. In fact, it is to
injustice that we may owe this poem: Perses, Hesiod's brother has tricked him in
a matter of inheritance. Moreover, the lords, to whom the poet had applied for
justice, had been bribed by Perses and have misjudged to his favor. The
complaint about this injustice, especially that of the lords, is of great importance,
since it reveals the fact that Hesiod (and thus any member of the community)
1

was not afraid to accuse the lords in public. Along with injustice, Hesiod warns
about a society ruled by the powerful, when he foretells about the future
generations that “law and decency will be in fists”, (West, Hesiod's Works and
Days 191). This ethical issue is also presented in the story of the hawk and the
nightingale. This tale is well known, although in a quite different version, as one
of Aesop's tales. The main difference between the two versions lies in the fact
that, in Aesop's tale, as in almost all of his tales, talking animals simply represent
some classes of people. Hesiod's version of the tale, on the other hand, reminds
us that people are actually very different from animals. In particular, he points out
that the law of the jungle that prevails in the world of animals should not
dominate our world too: “So spoke the swift-flying hawk, the great winged bird.
But you, Perses, must hearken to Right and not promote violence” (West,
Hesiod's Works and Days 213)
Apart from injustice, a very significant issue for the poet is that of religion.
Religion appears everywhere in the poem, from the first word, “Muses”, to the
last sentence, “well with god” (West, Hesiod's Works and Days 1, 826). The
belief that disobeying or tricking the Gods leads to disaster is emphasized by the
myth of Prometheus, whose action to steal the fire from Zeus lead to the fact that
a man must work to find his food, as well as to many other evils that were
released from Pandora's box. (Hesiod, Works and Days 48-104) Serving and
sacrificing to the immortals is another aspect of religion stressed by Hesiod
(Hesiod, Works and Days 336-7). Moreover, the failure to respect these rules is
implied as the main reason for the extinction of the second, Silver race of men:
According to the poet, the Gods destroyed the Silver race since they neglected to
offer respect to them (Hesiod, Works and Days 135-40).
Hesiod is also concerned with the moral issue of war and peace. While
Hesiod's world “is a world without war”, (Osborne, Greece in The Making p. 146)
the consequences of previous wars are presented in an effort to emphasize the
2

irrationality of violent actions and the importance of peace. An example is the
destruction of the Bronze race of men: With “woeful works of Ares and with acts
of violence ... they were laid low by their own hands” (West, Hesiod's Works and
Days 146-55) Peace is also praised in a non-mythological context, for its
beneficial effects on the land and the people. (West, Hesiod's Works and Days
225-37)
Moreover, a substantial part of Works and Days is concerned with the
relationships of people with their families as well as with community in general.
Hesiod foresees the decline of his own race, the Iron one, with reference to
people losing respect to their aging parents and blasting crude words towards
them. (West, Hesiod's Works and Days 185, 330). The poem also provides
advice for social behavior, in terms of neighbor relationships and donating to
society. Furthermore, he warns that the actions of a single man may adversely
affect the whole community. (West, Hesiod's Works and Days 260-6)
The above issues are the main moral concerns of Hesiod in Works and
Days. Beyond these elements, as the title suggests, Hesiod cites much practical
instruction as to how to work and when to do so. Even though this advice
constitutes a large proportion of the poem (about two thirds of it), a number of
reasons suggest that Works and Days is more about morality than it is about
practical teaching.
Firstly, I argue that most of the practical elements presented in the poem
are simply used as means to the end of teaching morality. The poem would be
incomplete without arguments and examples of how to implement the moral
theory cited. All of the practical advice found in Works and Days is associated to
one or more moral issues. For example, the largest part and the main theme of
Hesiod's practical advice is work, both in the land and the sea. The poet
organizes his advice very carefully, providing several subtasks and giving the
3

proper time margins in which each subtask should take place. However, one
should also regard the reasons why Hesiod describes in such detail how one
should work. Some of these reasons can be traced in the poem: Hesiod
mentions “whatever your fortune, work is preferable, that is, if you turn your
blight-witted heart from others' possessions towards work” (West, Hesiod's
Works and Days 313-5), giving the moral advantages of work: It keeps you from
stealing and being jealous of the others. In addition to this, work helps one avoid
begging for money or goods from others, a significant moral issue for the poet
who himself experiences Perses soliciting for food or employment. (West,
Hesiod's Works and Days 394-6) On the contrary, work allows you to offer
voluntarily, a moral action than brings pleasure to the giver. (West, Hesiod's
Works and Days 358-61)
Finally, there are several reasons that suggest that Works and Days is of
no significant practical value. Despite the length of the practical instruction in the
poem, the value of this teaching is doubtable, and compared to the moral
elements that have been cited above, it only constitutes a secondary feature.
First of all, the practical advice offered to the audience is no less known to the
average Greek of that age than it is to Hesiod. The poet does not suggest any
new discoveries or a new way of living; most of the advice can be classified as
common knowledge. It is well known that the main occupations of the Greeks at
the period were agriculture and sailing. In such a society, therefore, it is natural to
assume that people knew very well their jobs and that all the advice cited by
Hesiod was not secret or original. Another fact that supports the above is that
Hesiod himself had an extremely limited experience in sailing: “I have never yet
sailed the broad sea, except to Euboea from Aulis”, a distance of 65 meters
(West, Hesiod's Works and Days 647-9). This does not necessarily mean that
Hesiod made up of all these practical advice about sailing; rather that he himself
listened to the sailors and rephrased what he had heard in his poem, or used
other traditional poems and compiled them to a version of his own.
4

Furthermore, Hesiod's calendar is not as one could claim completely
didactic. A large portion of the calendar is superstitious and not practical at all:
An example of that is advice of this kind: “The middle 6th is ... good for a man's
birth; for a girl, however, it is not suitable, either to be born or to marry.” (West,
Hesiod's Works and Days 780-3) It would need extreme caution and luck to
make sure that a woman doesn't give birth to a child (boy or girl) in the middle 6th,
since she wouldn't know the sex of the child she was carrying. Finally, some of
the advice is simply common sense, both now and back then. One particular
example is the one about what to wear on your feet and how to cover your head
in the cold (Hesiod Works and Days 540-5) Later on, the poet advices the worker
to work before the dawn, in order to avoid the morning rain or the hot sun, and to
have a dog in order to protect his house. To summarize, clearly the poem does
not teach practical things to someone today, and from the above one can see
that if it did teach something to the people of those days, this was not practical
but moral.
In conclusion, Works and Days is a poem about morality. Hesiod is
concerned with almost all the moral issues of his world: Law, justice and
injustice, religion, peace and war, as well as matters of family and community,
issues that have tortured generations and are still torturing us today. A large part
of the poem is dedicated to some practical instruction, which, under a more
careful analysis, turns out to either be support for Hesiod's arguments about
morality or advice already known by the majority and thus of no significant
practical value. All these strongly suggest that Works and Days is more
concerned with moral rather than practical teaching.

Augustus
Suetonius, 79
His expression, whether in conversation or
when he was silent, was so calm and mild that one
of the leading men of the Gallic provinces admitted
to his countrymen that it had softened his heart,
and kept him from carrying out his design of
pushing the emperor over a cliff, when he had been
allowed to approach him under the pretence of a
conference, as he was crossing the Alps.
He had clear, bright eyes, in which he liked
to have it thought that there was a kind of divine
power, and it greatly pleased him, whenever he
looked keenly at anyone, if he let his face fall as if
before the radiance of the sun.

Res Gestae
1-2
1 At the age of nineteen, on my own initiative and at my own
expense, I raised an army by means of which I restored
liberty to the republic, which had been oppressed by the
tyranny of a faction. For which service the senate, with
complimentary resolutions, enrolled me in its order, in the
consulship of Gaius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius, giving me at
the same time consular precedence in voting; it also gave me
the imperium. As propraetor it ordered me, along with the
consuls, “to see that the republic suffered no harm.” In the
same year, moreover, as both consuls had fallen in war, the
people elected me consul and a triumvir for setting the
constitution.
2 Those who slew my father I drove into exile, punishing their
deed by due process of law, and afterwards, when they
waged war upon the republic, I twice defeated them in
battle…

"STS.464 :: The Intellectual History of Technology
The Marxist Critique of Capitalism
15 March 2005
Today in Class
What does Marxism contribute to our understanding of the circumstances that led to the need
for the concept of “technology?”
We need to be in the habit of thinking historically. Our inquiry only makes sense if you think
about it over time — an historical question.
One effect of the course is to sensitize you to the ambiguity inherent in the term.
If a professor can use the term “technology” over twenty times in one lecture, this should ring
an alarm signal! Problems of coherens of our thinking about the world.
At the beginning of the 19th century, the vocabulary that existed was sufficient for conversations
about the mechanic arts. However, at some point, a new conception emerged. The circumstances
of the development of society in 19th­ and 20th­century America called for another term, another
concept. “Machine” is not a good way to describe Dickens’s Coketown. Machines are a part of
it, but not it. “Mechanism” goes from artifact to concept.
Marx and Engels give us some valuable intellectual tools, remind us that this is a very recent
development. A word so commonly used doesn’t seem to need explanation.
A note about your papers: Be critical, make note of what places could stand improvement or
clarification. Class is a good time for workshopping, for sharpening the writing and thinking.
This course is not about semantics, but semantics enters into it...
Readings
This week’s readings span a range of years, and outline the evolution of Marxist thought in
this period. Keep in mind that Marx was writing in Germany, and the evolution of the term
“technology” in German is different than in English (see Schatzberg’s paper).
Marx uses “technology” in the more modern sense, i.e. as the mechanic arts themselves, rather
than the literature pertaining to them. The Oxford English Dictionary has “technology” as a set
of words, a jargon around a discipline.
Richard Poirier / Raritan
−→ novel as a technology of literature
1

Marx talks about the movement towards industrial capitalism −→ moving away from the individual
and towards systems.
Something happens when you set up workers in a factory with machines. Transfer of knowledge
and skills from men to machines. Workers are no longer separate from tools/machines.
Why is Marx so interested in machines? How does the machinery contribute to his political
thoughts?
• The machine fits into the Marxist system because it’s the mode of production (see S&D,
p. 68). This language has become incredibly important.
• Machines were forces of production, the production of people’s livelihood.
• Machines became more than just things −→ need for “technology”?
• Marx wasn’t interested in the machines themselves necessarily, but in the social system
surrounding them −→ need for term?
• Problem with relations of production, not just the means of production.
• Marx and Engels have no qualms about machines themselves.
The paradox of Marxism: Capitalism is the best and worst thing to have happened to society.
Marx’s image of drudgery was being a peasant/serf. Machines should be used in the workers’
interests, not those of the bourgeoisie. The machine itself is neutral, doesn’t have class loyalties.
Coercion of getting people to work in factories
−→ authority, hierarchy
−→ machines could be liberators — it was the factory owners causing drudgery
In 1848, half of the capitals of Europe were threatened by workers’ uprisings. The U.S. Navy
came to the rescue of many.
How long does the feeling last, that the revolution would be completed? 2 generations?
Can you really just change the ownership? Ascribing agency to the machines, in the person of
the capitalist −→ capitalists have built their interests into the machine.
E. P. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class
Rural/agricultural life:
• living outside the modern meands of production
• isolated, behind
• peasantry −→ reactionary conservative force
• rural areas have to be brought into the modern means of production
• globalization
Fear of capitalist industrialization? Russia as opposed to England...

Fusion of town and country that Marx talks about.
Discussion of student papers
Marxism developed from the writings of utopian socialists, who had idealized visions of the future.
Marx was influenced by them, but saw them as imputing agency to ideas. Marx was a materialist.
We create the material conditions to our survival, relations to our envionrment.
Technology: a system from which you cannot extract yourself, a sense of totality. Preceding
formulations had technology as discrete instruments −→ a necessary if not sufficient attribute
that it be a physical entity? “Technology” does not point to any concrete object — instead
it approaches totality: abstract, pliant, dematerialized, deliteralizing. At the same time that it
becomes pliant, it loses meaning. Capitalism is Marx’s word for this totality — it’s much more
concrete.
Using the word “technology” instead of “capitalism” depoliticizes it. The language for taming
capitalism is an issue.
See also Perrow, Normal Accidents −→ risk, accident
Production for use rather than profit.
Marx had the word “technology” at his disposal, but he chose to use “capitalism,” as that was
his focus.

First, environment and technology are intertwined
Three ways this happens:

• tracing the history of what we not call “technology” and its surrounding ideas, values, and
meanings
• cultural history as it is illuminated by the mechanic arts
Back to the main question: a word/concept which didn’t gain currency until recently (large­scale
usage emerges around WWII) −→ Why was it needed in the first place? What made the semantic
void that it filled? Constantly creating conditions that require new thought.
culture: a counter­term (Arnold), things that resisted modernity, mechanism, the instrumental­
ization of life
TODAY: Getting a handle on the concept of culture.
Discussion of Readings and Student Papers
metonymic −→ adjacent ideas?
Some aspects of technology:
1. teleology: moving towards some unarticulated force
2. totalization : the relatedness of technology to other aspects of life, consuming
3. fragmentation: professionalization, increasing specification and specialization −→ myopic
4. decorporealization: disembodiment
final stanza of Dover Beach −→ WWII
−→ the tenor of the age that tells us what’s really true
−→ the sensory impact of powerful technologies
−→ the sensory experience of technology

To a Locomotive in Winter −→ Locomotive and westward expansion, locomotive as instru­
ment/engine of democracy. never explicitly mentioned in the poem.
Passage to India −→ hymn to globalization and the mechanic arts
Art replaces religion in the modern context.
As technology becomes so totalizing, it’s not just a lack of direct sensory interaction, but an
increasing inability to read nature, a knowledge base that’s lost. Isolation of consciousness, lack
of ongoing experience and interaction.
Arnold: defining culture such that it is the opposite, the other to “technology”
“Technology” −→ absence in Arnold, promiscuous presence in Whitman −→ a British vs. Amer­
ican viewpoint
What is the fundamental difference between England and the U.S. that allowed Arnold to make
this distinction between culture and everything else? −→ A landed aristocracy. Arnold assumes
a class of people who don’t have to work for a living. His whole argument hinges on this.
Williams: English, didn’t come to U.S. before 1972, book about TV
Transformation of industry from a human virtue to a means...
Intrinsic Values Instrumental Values

compatible with criticism of technology;
old definition of culture) (compatible with valorizing of technology)

Whitman wanted to make technology compatible with culture, democracy.
Mumford, Technics and Civilization, 1934
Consider the titling of journals: Technology and Culture, History of Technology... Why was
“technology” chosen instead of, say, “engineering”?
What about Culture and Anarchy?
−→ self + common good = culture
−→ self only, selfishness = anarchy

Next Week: Systems & Networks
The concept of a unifying system has been latent in our discussion for the past few weeks.
Movement from the mechanic arts being aracterized by discrete entities −→ the factory system,
institutions, modes of behavior organized around and within machines.
By the time you get to the railroad (that emblem of industrialization and the new mechanistic
society), it’s not longer just an engine, it’s an elaborate system. Required a transformation of
the concept of time. No longer discrete things, but a complex of interlo cking things.
Two borders were crossed:
1. between the thing (e.g. locomotive) and the system that owns the thing (e.g. railroad
company): the mechanic arts and institutions around the mechanic arts
2. between the thing and society: the penetration of culture and society by these systems
Also: production systems (e.g. Fordist) and connective systems (e.g. rainroad, telegraph, trans­
portation and communication)
Adam Smith: system as an imaginitive machine
Thomas Hughes, Networks of Power
−→ how historians deal with technological systems
−→ compares US and German electrical systems
Chandler: The typical American business before the railroad was a family business. A new system
like the railroad called forth a new system of management −→ rise of corporations.

"STS 007 Discovery of Prehistory
The history of prehistory: or, historical and scientific studies
How much development of modern science and modern historical studies are intertwined
NB: Assign Steven Mithen, “Freedom Through Cooking,” NYRB , Oct. 22 2009, 44‐46.
Also assign “Fire as an Engineering Tool of Early Modern Humans”
And how much this affects what we know and how we think about “technology in history”
Convergence of “natural history” and “natural philosophy”
You can see this today in your examples
Also in two optional readings on site for today – role of optional readings: giving you ideas for a project
Part of a very exciting convergence – limits to written documents – other types of documents: in the
land and in biology, also in linguistics – from written to other material record – “deep background
conditions” (Bernard Bailyn) ‐ need to “cable together” different types of evidence (see Lewis‐Williams
reading for next week)
Archaeology, ethology, genetics, paleontology, anthropology, linguistics
e.g. Jane Goodall going to Kenya July 14, 1961, to work where Leakey had been digging – to live with
chimpanzees, became another thread in the skein (not skeletons but behavior: ethology)
She actually took the time to study how chimpanzees live – they make tools, hunt animals, eat meat,
and brutally kill members of their own species
But you need to contextualize it – put it with other evidence – genetics, linguistics, archaeology,
geology, conventional documents as available, imagination most of all
Also: A long trend in historical studies to giving voice to the voiceless (women, children, workers…)
Uncovering “people without history”
“dark ages” as e.g.
Globe article: other examples: environmental history, neurological history, also ocean history (our own
David Mindell) –
1

Deep background conditions: most salient one of all is length of time involved in human history
The discovery of deep space, “From the closed world to the infinite universe”
Esp. with galaxies (Kant, Wm Herschel) – even by late l800s not entirely clear but possibility was
recognized
Also deep time, a new world of the past, previously unsuspected, puts whole new lights on “technology
in history”
The discovery of deep time is especially connected with the earth sciences/ geology
Common Western textual record:
Old Testament Biblical framework in Near East – pharaohs, Sumer, Babylon, Egypt)
New Testament ancient civilizations (Rome, Greece)
This is the record that Europeans saw: Bishop Ussher, 1654, 4004 BC as time of creation
Uncovering deep time began with cataloging minerals and fossils
Georg Bauer/Agricola from central Europe, many mines there (Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony) –
1494‐1555, De Re Metallica 1556 (translated by Herbert and Lou Clarke Hoover 1912)
Hard to get evidence underground
Seemed jumbled, disorganized; minerals appeared here and there – order in the heavens but not on
earth
Began mining academies in late 1700s – engineering school – schools of mining (even today: Paris,
Colorado)
Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750‐1817) – mining family – collected minerals
Neptunists vs. Vulcanists (Hutton) in 1780s –
Earth’s crust laid down when a primitive ocean subsided
Vs. volcanic action being main driver of change
2

But meant a testable hypothesis – strata laid down in orderly series – a universal stratigraphic column
was agreed upon by 1800
How deep does it go? How does it relate to Biblical time?
Correlate geological and fossil record – “Flesh of paleontology” added to layers of rock esp. by Georges,
Baron Cuvier 1769‐1832
Excavations in Paris basin early 1800s – many quarries there: can still visit “the catacombs of Paris”
(limestone quarry, also site for overflow from cemeteries)
Predictability of rock strata extended over 100 km
Specialist in comparative anatomy – first to reconstruct extinct animals from fragmentary remains –
hippos, rhinos, cavebears, mastodons, crocodiles, tigers
“Le regne animal” (the animal kingdom) pub. 1817 – epic work – later editions, expanded, hugely
influential – this is from the Paris edition appearing from 1836‐1849 – hand colored (engravings)
Much larger and stranger animals too:
Mystery: how are these animals related to existing ones?
Cuvier a “catastrophist” – species are fixed, lifeforms succeed each other due to a series of sudden and
overwhelming geological catastrophes ‐ 27 in all – Noah’s flood the last one
Why not human fossils? Sinners who perished in the Flood? Would lie at the bottom of the deepest
ocean, he believed – human fossils did not exist
“wrong” but like earlier argument (Neptune/Pluto) led to more research and agreement on basic point:
mighty natural events in the past have laid down a geological record that is also a chronological record
of earth’s past
Also, beginning to be clear that the scale of geologic time had to be long enough for seas to become
land and vice versa
Race to fill in the stratigraphic column –
Charles Lyell, Principles of Geology 1830‐33, first edition – stratigraphic table open at the bottom – great
defender of “uniformitarianism” as opposed to a series of catastrophes
(Darwin took it along on the voyage of the Beagle)
Frontispiece to the book speaks of not‐so‐deep time (columns from classical antiquity)
3

Different classes of rock, many processes that over a long time results in what we see
William Buckland 1784‐1856 – chair in mineralogy at Oxford – pioneer in cave research
Also believed in floods, but not so catastrophic
Did not believe fossil human would be found – nor did Lyell – assumed humans were “non‐fossilized
apex of creation”
Long known that caves in Europe sheltered bones of species that no longer existed or no longer lived in
the area ‐ wouldn’t animals trying to escape the flood take refuge there? Bones would be preserved
esp. in limestone caves where water dripping from the roof would cover the bones with a protective
coating of stalagmite
Started exploring caves in Germany in 1816, also worked in UK – very careful work
Reliquiae Diluvianae (relics of the flood) – 1823 “Observations on the Organic remains contained in
caves, fissures, and diluvial gravel, and on other geological phenomena attesting the action of a
universal deluge”
But no human fossils – he was eager to find this as evidence of the Mosaic Deluge
Goat Hole Cave, in south Wales – human‐like skeleton found there – sketch from RD – Buckland wrote in
RD that it was relatively recent, maybe Roman times
Next year a Roman Catholic chaplain working at Oxford, interested in excavations, flint and bone tools
found next to bones of extinct animals (mammoth, cave bear) in Kent’s Cavern, Devon – sealed beneath
limestone – Buckland insisted that “ancient Britons” had lived in upper levels of cave, scooped out
“ovens” in the stalagmite, their tools had fallen down the holes
Similar reactions to caves along the Meuse/Maas, where implements (ivory, flint, bone) and a human
skull found along with bones of extinct animals
Wanted to find human remains, but these were mixed with fantastic animals, unmentioned in
scriptures, bizarre forms of life – never let go of belief that humankind was not changing, would be no
fossils found – humans relatively new
Time of great uncertainty – good reason to be skeptical in reading too much into scattered remains
Many other excavations going on, in UK and Europe, including more findings of intact bone caves, with
flint knives below a bed of stalagmite in which the bones of mammoths and cave bears were found
4

Neandertal remains 1820s (baffling), 1848, also 1856 ( skulls uncovered in earlier decades, 1820s and
1840s, simply called “ancient humans”) the 1856 skeleton was more complete – puzzling: remains
scattered by workmen in the quarry, no animal remains found with it, age unknown
Strange shape of the skull: low narrow forehead, large ridges over the eyes, thick cranial bones, knot at
bottom of skull – suprainiac fossa, a groove above the inion, the place on the bone at the back end of
the human skull that juts out the farthest (occipital bun)
Key event: French researcher Jacques Boucher de Perthes had been collecting items esp. hand axes
from river gravel dredging in northern France, including a stone axe buried in an antler – two
Englishmen visited, Joseph Prestwich and John Evans, both amateurs, businessmen, but obsessed with
mapping surface deposits known as drift – now glacial drift – visited gravel pit near Amiens (Jules Verne
living in the neighborhood, very interested in this kind of scientific discovery, J to Center of Earth 1864) –
Boucher de Perthes was old, didn’t have credibility –
they were esp. interested in an object that lay 17 feet underground, four and a half feet up from the
base of a river terrace cut into a chalk slope – the edge of a worked flint tool – first to be fine in situ, in
gravel that also had bones of woolly rhinos and mammoths – they asked three local reps of the Society
of Antiquities of Picardie to witness this –
photograph of breaking the time barrier – 27 April 1859
not clear who the people are – one pointing to the flint tool
returned to UK – planned their scientific attack – spoke first to Royal Society May 26 (Faraday, Babbage,
Huxley and Lyell in the audience) – then Society of Antiquities of London, then Geological Society
Lyell changed his mind about great human antiquity, visited the Somme – St. Achuel is the site, so
Acheulean tools
Lyell announced this at a meeting (packed) of the British AAS, with Prince Albert there: “A vast lapse of
ages…[separates] the era in which fossil implements were framed and that of the invasion of Gaul by the
Romans.”
A month later in 1859 Origin of Species is published – sidesteps human evolution, which was dealt with
later in The Descent of Man 1871 –
But Darwin’s friends and allies almost immediately recognized the implications, that humans too had
evolved –
Lyell presented a skull to Huxley, who “remarked at once that it was the most apelike skull he had ever
beheld” –
5

Huxley 1863 Man’s Place in Nature – long discussion of the skull, refuting those who thought it was that
of an “idiot,” Cossack or “powerfully organized Celt,” i.e. it resembled the skull of a modern Irishman
with low mental organization
Huxley insisted it was that of an apelike human: “it is singular how often the dream [of ancient
traditions] turns out to have been a half‐waking one, presaging a reality….though the quaint forms of
centaurs and satyrs have an existence only in the realms of Art, creatures approaching man more nearly
than they in essential structure…are now not only known, but notorious.”
Science had led not to Biblical history but to a previously unknown history, which tested humankind’s
sense of identity and specialness as never before
Image of the skull: imagination, consciousness of prehistory – like Galileo turning telescope to the moon:
new things never before seen, man’s place in nature, heavy‐browed, heavy‐jawed
Who were they? How did they live? What does this mean? Skull doesn’t tell you this –
1864 discovery of a piece of ivory drawn with a hairy mammoth in La Madeleine, nearby
In 1868 railway line (progress!) being put in near Les Eyzies – involved blasting open a rock shelter in a
cliff – found 4 skeletons like those Buckland had found in Kent’s cavern – tall, large brained (Neandertals
also), long‐headed – formally buried with pierced shells and other ornaments ‐ called Cro‐Magnon after
the rock shelter
Became clear the Cro‐Magnons had succeeded the Neandertals
Sir John Lubbock, Prehistoric Times 1865 – widely ready – “of late years a new branch of knowledge has
arisen, a new science has….been born among us, which deals with times and events far more ancient
than any which have yet fallen within the province of the archaeologist…Archaeology forms the link
between geology and history.”
New science, new word, railway line, “technology” emerging as a concept: all happening at once
Serious excavations in Kent’s Cavern, 1865‐1880 – calculated from stalagmite growth rates that stone
tools under them were half a million years old – then sold to family 1903, used as a workshop and then a
tourist attraction – during the cave tours lights are turned off, stone age shell lamps are used
Discovery of cave art
See preface to Lewis Williams: record of entrance into Niaux 1660, tourist attraction, natural wonder –
leaves name and date on wall, a meter from images of bixon and ibex – images all o ver the wall, don’t
seem to get much attention
Like the word “technology” – it is there but no one pays much attention
“rediscovery” begins 1861

Democracy:
Starting with Solon
In the present day, the term “democracy” is well known. In any democracy, the
common people have power. However, each democratic government has a unique way
of implementing this concept of common rule. There arises the difficulty in designating
what exactly constitutes a democracy, and at which point a non-democratic government
crosses the boundary into democracy. The political reforms implemented by Solon
around the beginning of the sixth century B.C. demonstrate some revolutionary
democratic aspects, but also contradict many democratic ideals, representing an ongoing
dilemma concerning the implementation of the contract between a democratic
government and its people. Although not necessarily democratic by modern standards,
Solon’s reforms are frequently considered democratic in the context of the time period in
which he was politically active because they were the first motions towards what would
later become the basis for democracy.
One of the most basic elements of democracy is the distribution of power
throughout the people. Prior to Solon, power had generally been centralized in one man,
or within a small aristocratic class. Control was often hereditary, and Solon’s shift away
from this traditional class system was a huge step for democracy. A huge component of
Solon’s reforms was the restructuring of the social system into economic classes, as
“Wealth brings worth and prestige (Hesiod, 46)1”, according to Hesiod. At first glance,
this change to monetary distinction doesn’t seem to improve the stratification of the
people. However, since it was possible to accumulate wealth through trade and good
business ventures, the new economic system allowed social mobility. This was in direct
contrast to the pre-existing aristocratic system, in which newly wealthy people were not
allowed to hold the same official positions as those who had inherited their wealth and
therefore their political influence. The reform went so far as to draw office holders by
lots, so that there was strict equality within a given class. Solon also accounted for the
reality that economic gain, while possible, was not always a simple task by providing an

opportunity for any member of the top three of the four tiers he had just created to hold
political office.
To the lowest economic class, which was denied the right to hold any official
office, Solon gave the right to act as jurors. Both Plutarch and Aristotle claimed this to
be “absolutely critical (Plutarch, 62)2” because “when people are masters of the vote they
are masters of the state (Aristotle, 50)3”. The jury is clearly important in deciding the
cases that come before them, but the law granting the right of appeal to a popular court
meant that there was the possibility for any case, even one that was originally tried by
office-holders, to come before a jury of the bottom class. This gave the “hired hands
(Plutarch, 61)”, as the lowest class was called, a method with which to affect the
government of Athens. There was speculation that Solon went so far as to write his laws
in vague words, so that they were open to interpretation and required the services of the
popular jury to make any final decisions concerning their intentions, and ensure that the
hired hands had influence. The flexibility of the economic system democratized
Athenian culture by eliminating the emphasis on familial status and background, and by
allowing all citizens to participate in some manner of the government regardless of their
social position.
Solon satisfied other requirements for the democratic title as well, by introducing
the concept of individual rights to the people. Encompassed in the idea of individual
rights is the belief that an individual has inherent worth and that all individuals are equal.
Individual rights also include the right of a person to make his or her own choices, and
most importantly, the protection of these rights by law. Solon’s law prohibiting the use
of a person as collateral indicates a sentiment that an individual is something more than a
bargaining chip, fulfilling the first aspect of individual rights. All people, including
Solon himself, were subject to the same set of laws, which were written down on the
Kyrbeis and posted in the Portico of the Basileus (Aristotle, 48) for all to see. An
example where the right to make choices entered into Solon’s reforms is in his laws on
inheritances. Under Solon’s laws, a man could decide, within a set of regulations, who

was to receive his money and land after his death. Previously, the inheritance had
automatically gone to surviving family members.
Almost more important than legislation on individual rights is the ability to
protect those rights for all people by law. Solon accounted for this by allowing “anyone
who wished to seek retribution for those who were wronged (Aristotle, 50)” to do so.
This law prevented people from taking advantage of the poorer classes, because another
citizen with adequate funding could step up to make the case. Solon also instituted more
generalized protections, such as making it a crime to rape a free woman (Plutarch, 67)
and ensuring that decisions were made independently of any influences that might be
responsible for “undermining a person’s powers of reason (Plutarch, 65)”.
His socio-economic reforms and his institution of individual rights as described
above make a decent case for the democracy of Solon’s policies. However, by the same
definitions of democracy as were used to demonstrate the opposite, some of Solon’s
legislation is considered severely anti-democratic.
Solon’s reorganization of the class system helped to alleviate restrictions based on
heritage, but still reserved positions for each class. The higher classes held the more
important offices. For example, election to the Archonship and therefore the Areopagus
was limited to only the top class. The Areopagus “administered most and the greatest of
the city’s affairs (Aristotle, 44)” and were consequently more powerful. While Solon’s
system was much more compliant than the one he overrode, it was still a far cry from
democracies of today. In the United States, any citizen of adequate age may hold any
office if they receive the majority of votes, regardless of their social or economic class.
Practically, it may be prove extremely difficult for any US citizen to gain that majority
vote, but it was legally possible. Similarly there was an opportunity to move upwards
within the class structure of Solon’s system, but the required economic gain was also not
a simple task to accomplish.
Additionally, Solon’s class system limited citizenship. Therefore office holding
was limited as well, excluding women for example, and only allowing exiles and those
with families as well as a profession to become naturalized citizens. Likewise, the US
government initially excluded blacks and women from voting and office holding
privileges. As time progressed, these groups fought for their rights to do so, recognizing
3

Paper 2 Cheryl Texin
21h.301
that those privileges are a central part of being a member in a democracy. Currently,
there is a general sentiment that a democracy cannot exclude people based on race and
color. Individual rights were indirectly affected by a lack of citizenship, as well.
Without citizenship and the right to participate in the legal process it becomes difficult to
implement and protect personal rights. Women had restrictions on what they could wear,
what they could carry, and how they could travel, for example.
Solon infringed on individual rights in other ways, as well. He created laws on
marriage, mourning, and trade. The presence and restrictions of the laws eliminated the
need for the individual to make the decision that is appropriate for them. Solon required
that everyone participate in a political dispute, or be punished (Plutarch, 63 and Aristotle,
50). This eradicates the right of a person to make the choice to remain outside of the
dispute. However, it is nearly impossible to write a code of laws that looks to protect
both the government as a whole and its individual citizens at the same time. Solon
implemented the “law of denunciation” in which it was legal to try “those charged with
conspiring to dissolve the democracy (Aristotle, 49)”. The freedom of expression that is
a key element of a democracy does not go so far as to allow people to express oneself in a
manner contrary to the democracy. This is not unique to Solon’s reforms, however; the
US has similar laws governing treason and conspiracy, and additionally refuses to allow
people to remove themselves from the democracy, as was demonstrated by the Civil War.
The reforms of Solon were therefore not always entirely democratic, but closely reflect
the origins of democracy in the US.
Furthermore, when deciding whether Solon’s reforms can accurately be termed
democratic, one must consider the fact that Solon did not have previous democracies to
examine. Because of this, it is fair to bear in mind Solon’s intentions when he
implemented his policies, regardless of their current standing as democratic or not.
The main proof indicating that Solon’s intentions were democratic was his refusal
to take up the position of tyrant when it was freely offered to him (Plutarch, 44). Both of
the disputing factions that drove his policies were unhappy with his reforms but “he
preferred to incur the hatred of both by saving his country and legislating for the best
(Aristotle, 51)”. He recognized that democracy is unfavorable as an immediate solution,
but much preferable in the long run, and therefore “secured the laws against alteration for
4

Paper 2 Cheryl Texin
21h.301
a hundred years (Aristotle, 48)” so that the people had time to grow accustomed to them.
Many of Solon’s reforms, seemingly anti-democratic, were founded in a desire to protect
the people from themselves. For example, he instituted restrictive laws on marriage to
ensure that unions were being made for mutual affection, rather than “mercenary and
commercial (Plutarch, 64)” reasons. Of his own laws, Solon admits they were not ideal,
but “They were the best [the Athenians] would accept (Plutarch 58)”. This implies that
Solon was even more democratically minded than his legislation demonstrated, but he
was intelligent enough to realize that the people weren’t ready to receive such novel
ideas. Indeed, upon Solon’s self-imposed exile, Athens crept back towards tyranny under
Pisistratus.
People consider Solon democratic not only because his reforms were democratic
by modern terms, but rather that, placed within the context of his time, his reforms were
exceptionally democratic and paved the way for increasing democracy in the future.
Solon implemented a new class system that allowed social mobility, and also gave each
class a role within the democracy. He began to develop the concept of individual rights,
while instituting legislation to protect those rights for all people. Solon overcame popular
discontent with his reforms, and demonstrated his devotion to the democratic movement
by rejecting offers to become a tyrant. He attempted to define the relationship between
the government and the people through his laws while recognizing that the people were
not ready to accept his ideals. Many of his policies would fit well in democratic
institutions of modern times, and many of those that would be rejected by today’s
standards have been adapted from his original ideas. Solon’s commitment and
innovation paved the way for democracy as we see it today.

"Reading questions on Christian, Chapter 8: “Intensification and the Origins of Agriculture”
(Beginning of Part Four, The Holocene, “Few Worlds”)
Read pp. 206-211 carefully (including tables and figures). Make sure you get the big picture of
the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, the end of the last ice age, the distinction
between “extensification” and “intensification,” and the significance of the Neolithic Revolution
(and make sure you can define and date these terms).
What are the three world zones of the early Holocene? (212-215, including figures)
What is domestication? Give some examples of life forms that are domesticated. How is
domestication different from agriculture? Is domestication a (bio)technology? (216-218)
When did domestication begin? What did it begin with? Describe in general terms the sequence
of places and organisms that were domesticated in the Neolithic Revolution (see table on p. 219
as well as text). (218-222)
What are the relationships among foraging, domestication, and agriculture? Did one lead to the
other or did they coexist for long periods? (222)
Christian’s discusses agriculture as an invention (222-224). Is is a simultaneous invention or one
that spread from a central source? Is this an invention that can be described as “progress” in the
usual meaning of that word? (223-224) What are its costs and benefits?
Was there “resistance to change” in the adoption of agriculture? (223-224) Was this a rational
resistance? If so, how was it overcome? Why did so many humans adopt agriculture as the basis
of their lives? (224-234; see esp. summaries on 225 and 236) Explain the various roles of
preconditions, global triggers
What is sedentism? What is its relation to agriculture? What is its effect on population? (233-
236) Did it precede or succeed agriculture? What is the “trap of sedentism”? (235) Can you think
of other examples of a similar technological “trap”?
What is horticulture, and how is it different from agriculture? (238-239)
Describe early agrarian communities as an apparently stable and widespread form of human
social life. How were the organized, and how did they interact with each other? (239-242) What
can we speculate about the consciousness of humans in these communities? What was their
effect on the rest of the natural world? (242-43)

Plutarch wrote the Parallel Lives in the beginning of the 2nd century AD as a set
of biographies meant to be read by prominent Roman and Grecian statesmen of the time.
These biographies covered the major Greek and Roman historical figures, and were
written in pairs, one Greek and one Roman whose lives Plutarch saw as parallel.
Plutarch’s intention was that these biographies would act as a mirror – that in reading the
lives of others, his readers might see part of themselves in a particular character. Then,
by viewing the outcomes of a character’s actions or personality, Plutarch’s readers could
rationally evaluate their own actions and traits with some idea of the consequences. For
this purpose, it was important that Plutarch was writing about real men to whom
Plutarch’s audience could relate. Rather than just being told about the ideal
consequences or outcome of ideal behaviors, biography allowed Plutarch to bring his
readers much closer to real observation. Still, this does not mean that Plutarch kept
strictly to historical fact, nor does it mean he didn’t shape his subjects’ lives to suit his
purpose. His main goal was to show character and its connection to the rest of a person’s
life and not to simply write history. These priorities are revealed in the lives of Lycurgus
and Solon through the use of stories and anecdotes of questionable historic accuracy, and
the inclusion or exclusion of information in order to portray a character that fit Plutarch’s
design. In reading Plutarch for historical reasons, one must keep Plutarch’s purpose in
mind. The story and interpretation must be set aside as simply that, but the society and
political ideas and systems of early Athens and Sparta are portrayed, and this is valuable
to a reader of history.
In Lycurgus and Solon, much of the text is stories, which serve well to illustrate
the individual character and personality of each man, but may have had more value as
parables than history. Many of these stories were likely passed on orally from generation
to generation. Thus at the time Plutarch knew them, hundreds of years later, they
probably could not have been considered historically accurate. Yet Plutarch not only

includes these stories, he comments on them and interprets how each story shows some
aspect of his subject’s character. For example, he does not simply tell the story of
Lycurgus’ eye, he uses it to comment on Lycurgus character. Plutarch describes
Lycurgus as “uniquely gentle and even tempered,” with his “self-possession and high-
mindedness, his ascetic lifestyle, and his inexhaustible capacity for hard work” (Plut.,
Lycurgus 11). In this way, Plutarch creates a character that fits well with the Lycurgan
reforms. In Solon, the story of Croesus is included to build Solon’s character as a
philosopher, and in this case Plutarch even admits that many people think the story is
untrue. Plutarch, however, felt that since it was “so much in keeping with Solon’s
character and worthy of self-assurance” (Plut., Solon 27), he must not reject the story. He
proceeds to tell the story of Solon’s meeting with Croesus and indeed it does portray
Solon as a wise and honest man. Many other stories are similarly used to indicate the
personalities of Solon or Lycurgus. The story of Lycurgus making sure the rightful heir
to the throne would be born attested to his righteousness. The stories about Solon’s
capture of Salamis show his leadership qualities and clever thinking, and the stories of
Solon’s interactions with other sages and philosophers of the time establish Solon as a
philosopher himself. In using stories such as these, especially the Croesus story which is
likely untrue, Plutarch reveals that he is not concerned with relating the exact history of
Solon or Lycurgus, but with creating character. It doesn’t really matter whether either
story of Salamis’ capture is right or not, and Plutarch includes both of them. The
importance is that they serve to fill in the character of Solon.
As well as using stories to create his subject’s character, Plutarch also excludes or
discredits stories which do not fit his design. The krypteia, an institution where young
Spartans were sent out with daggers to kill promising helots, is something Plutarch claims
was not part of Lycurgus’ reforms. He states, “I myself would be reluctant to attribute to
Lycurgus a disgusting institution like the krypteia. I base this judgment of his character
on his equitability and fairness in other respects” (Plut., Lycurgus 28). Plutarch “selects
only those elements which fit his purpose” (Stadter (1998) p. 7), Stadter says, for
Xenophon’s account of the Spartans includes much more about the military, but Plutarch
does not include this information.

It is important to Plutarch that the stories he includes create a character that is
consistent with their history and politics. If Plutarch can argue that a certain battle or
piece of legislation rationally follows from a person’s character, then the biography has
more value as a philosophical mirror. Talking about a law of Solon’s, Plutarch writes,
“there is a saying of Solon’s that has come down to us which is consistent with this piece
of legislation” (Plut., Solon 18) and then gives the saying. This saying of Solon’s was
probably not related to the law, but Plutarch makes the connection between them to show
a similarity between character and political action.
In some cases, Plutarch fits his subject’s character to political actions, but in
others, he fits the political actions to the character. Plutarch attributes a great number of
laws and political changes to Solon and Lycurgus which may be more accurately seen as
changes made by many men over a longer time period. Solon, at least, is seen as a real
historical figure but there is no information in writings, such as his poems, which gives
detail of the laws. For this, Plutarch had to go to the written record of the laws himself,
perhaps the ones inscribed in wooden tablets, fragments of which Plutarch says “have
survived right up to modern times in the City Hall” (Plut., Solon 25). Yet it is not certain
whether Plutarch would have been able to know with certainty that Solon actually was
responsible for all the laws he claims. In his introduction to Solon, Stadter writes that
“there is the possibility that some provisions ascribed to Solon in fact reflect later
changes” (Stadter (1998) p. 42). It is possible that for a time after Solon, the laws were
all recorded on the wooden tablets and later just referred to as Solon’s laws even though
some were created by others.
Lycurgus, on the other hand, is not even a definite historical figure. Plutarch
admits that this is the case and that “there are divergent accounts” of “precisely what he
achieved with regard to the laws and the constitution” (Plut., Lycurgus 1). Certainly the
sense of a man Lycurgus existing is similar to that of Homer, where it is debatable as to
whether or not Homer wrote the poems or even existed. In the same sense, as Stadter
puts it, “we must remain in doubt whether a single major legislator existed, or whether in
later times a pattern of unwritten traditions was ascribed to this semi-legendary figure”
(Stadter (1998) p. 4). Still it suited Plutarch’s purpose to sum up the Spartan system and
tell it as Lycurgus’ creation, pulling it together to make a neat little biography.

Attributing a set of reforms to one man both in Solon and Lycurgus, again allows Plutarch
to connect character and moral value to the political sphere. It allows Plutarch to portray
a man of good virtue and character and then show how that leads to a whole set of
positive reforms and actions.
Writing biographies which compared a Greek and Roman figure also shows how
Plutarch connected similar characters and actions. Certainly, by writing lives in parallel,
Plutarch was directly showing that two different men of similar character could end up
leading similar lives. This further supports Plutarch’s belief that his readers could
compare their own lives to his biographies in order to gain insight. To write these
parallel lives, it is likely that Plutarch had to stretch his characters’ lives to make them fit.
Solon, for instance, is paired with the Roman Publicola, who “took decisive action
against attempts to reinstitute tyranny” (Stadter (1998) p. 44) and was a founder of the
Roman republic. Because of this pairing, it’s possible to imagine that Plutarch
overemphasized Solon’s rejection of and outspokenness against tyranny, and his role as
the founder of democracy.
Plutarch’s belief in Greek education and philosophy influenced his writing in
many ways. Plutarch himself was greatly influenced by Aristotle and Plato and
frequently cites them in both lives. He believed in the philosophy that people could
progress in virtue, and that observation of a fault and its affects in others was important in
realizing its affects in one’s own life. The Lives show this belief, as they give their
readers a way to observe traits and affects in statesmen of the past. Other indications of
Plutarch’s background as a philosopher are evident at various times throughout Lycurgus
and Solon. In telling about Lycurgus’ laws, Plutarch goes into great depth about the
philosophy behind the reforms. He explains how the revoking of money solved many
problems. For, “who would set out to embezzle, or accept as a bribe, or rob, or steal
something which was impossible to conceal, which no one particularly wanted to have,
and which could not even be profitably cut up” (Plut., Lycurgus 9), Plutarch reasons. He
talks of the whole system as being quite ideal, based on simplicity and moderation and an
eye to the public good. Stadter sums it up, stating that “Lycurgus is not just history, but a
statement of the value of the simple, disciplined, communitarian life against the
individualist pursuit of pleasure” (Stadter (1998) p. 7). There is a philosophical element

to Solon as well, with his stance on money and wealth. Plutarch includes excerpts from
Solon’s poetry in which one verse equates the happiness of a man rich in silver and a man
who has “only enough to keep belly, body and feet in comfort, and to enjoy the youthful
bloom of woman and boy…” (Plut., Solon 2). Plutarch’s inclusion of the Croesus story
further adds to the philosophical content.
In one instance, Plutarch directly goes off on a philosophical tangent about
marriage. All of chapter 7 from Solon is a philosophical digression about Thales’ refusal
to marry, and he goes on about how “it is strange and churlish behaviour to be so afraid
of losing things that one forgoes what one ought to have” (Plut., Lycurgus 7). With a
philosophical slant to much of the description of the political systems in Athens and
Sparta, one must refrain from believing that historically these political systems worked
exactly as they were described. Plutarch describes the ideal system, but in reality, the
situation was probably somewhat less than ideal in both city-states. For example, in
Athens, Solon’s laws were against tyranny, but soon after he created them, a tyranny was
instituted.
Overall, the lives of Solon and Lycurgus do give a good impression of early
Athens and Sparta, respectively. Plutarch’s life of Lycurgus is a great account of the
whole Spartan system, which was certainly a historical reality, albeit an ideal version.
The council of elders, the redistribution of land, and the abolishment of money were three
important parts of Spartan history, whether due to Lycurgus or not. The entire social and
public system described is also of great historical value. The system of common messes,
barracks, and the education system were quite unique to Sparta and important to any
understanding of ancient Greece. The system described in Solon for Athens is equally
useful historically. The council of 400, the ‘alleviation’ of debt, the creation of new
property classes, and the right of appeal to a popular court were all an integral part of the
history of Athens. The social and public laws described in Solon as well give an even
more in depth understanding of the city’s structure. Certainly the truth of these things
can be doubted, but their truth is certainly more evident than the truth of stories of one
event or person. The system of government and the social system were systems in place
for long periods of time and affected a whole group of people. In the case of Solon’s
laws, many were written down directly. Thus while the details such as when some of

these reforms took place, or who they should be attributed to, may not be clear, the
results certainly are much more grounded. Plutarch himself was well educated and well
read, taking much of his information from historical sources that are not available to
historians today.
As with any piece of literature to be read for historical value, whether reading
Herodotus, Thucydides, Aeschylus, or Homer, the works by Plutarch must be read with
knowledge of his purpose and background. Who was the author and when was he
writing? Was he writing about events he would have witnessed? Was the goal
entertainment, or perhaps persuasion? Who was the audience? These are all important
questions in determining how to evaluate a work’s historical value.
Thucydides, for example, was an Athenian general who lived through the
Peloponnesian War and was writing, he claims, an objective account of the war for the
sake of history. He claims to have only included those accounts which are the most
accurate, but in the same way that Plutarch may include or exclude information to create
his character, Thucydides’ own personal opinions and bias towards different people in his
history may have influenced what he chose to write and not to write. On the other hand,
Homer’s work is mainly fictional and must be read as such. Any historical value derived
from Homer must be inferred through his depiction of social structure, custom, and
motivation, and cannot be connected to actual times, events or places, but can only be
used as a general idea of the society at some point in history before Homer.
Plutarch was writing biography for the sake of observing character and the
outcome of a given person. In the case of Lycurgus and Solon, Plutarch was writing
hundreds of years after their deaths and thus was not writing about his contemporaries, as
Thucydides would have been. Neither are his accounts purely fiction or written for
purely entertainment purposes. Plutarch, rather, is somewhere in between fiction and
historical fact, and while Solon and Lycurgus may not be the most accurate sources of
actual events, people and places, the depiction of the structure of society in early Athens
and Sparta in these two respective works is invaluable."

Leo’s Lecture
Conference at the Dibner Institute this past weekend on “Reconceptualizing the Industrial Rev­
olution” Main emphasis (Castells, Mindell) −→ the role of the state much more conspicuously
present in sponsoring industrialization.
Britain −→ navy supporting nascent industrial system
Industrialization as a product of the consumer revolution −→ quality of British goods known
around the world.
What were the important technical innovations that enabled the Industrial Revolution?
• mechanized motive power replacing wind/water/animal/human power
• metal replacing wooden construction
• freestanding machines −→ factory system (a system inside and out)
• creation of an obedient labor force, selling labor by the hour −→ reconceptualization of
labor
• the railroad: freestanding machine + large network + specially trained labor force + new
disciplines (e.g. management)
• a new managerial force −→ impersonal management around the clock, all year round
• incorporation −→ no more family firms
Standardization of time −→ Peter Galison, Einstein’s Clocks, Poincar´e’s Maps
Ros’s Lecture
The word “system” −→ David Mindell’s paper, Bodies, Ideas, Dynamics
Use of “system” in relation to things mechanical first appears in 1830, and comes into common
use in the 1950s −→ tracks indentically with “technology”
Prior uses of “system”
1. physiological context (e.g. respiratory system, circulatory system)
2. philosphical/legal context (e.g. systems of thought, law)
3. dynamic, cosmological context (e.g. solar system)
−→ These three senses of the word are still shaping the way people think about systems.

What are the iconic uses of systems?
1. factory system
(a) American system
(b) Fordism
(c) Taylorism (“the system shall be first”)
2. canals
3. railroads
4. telegraph
5. postal system (International Postal Union c. 1850)
6. roads
7. electrical (distribution)
8. telephone

14. Internet
15. public school system and other social services and systems
Mindell: underwater archaeology, economic history
When do people start thinking of the world as a system? Around the 1930s.
“A nexus of techniques reinforcing each other in certain ways.”
19th century −→ visibility of the network makes it a technological artifact
20th century −→ “seeing the virtual network”
Marx & Castells: real power is the flow of capital
paper money −→ form of writing
Cronon, Nature’s Metropolis, chapter on the futures market
faith in the financial system
dissociation, abstraction −→
classification system, receipts; also the invention of the grain elevator
turning things into flows
Technological determinism in this example:
• soft: the grain elevator enabled this to happen, but didn’t explicitly cause it
• hard: imputes to the invention an initiating power, the grain elevator technology is the
driving/initiating force
2

Liquidity, commodification, machinery of representation, technologies that make you able to make
one thing stand for something else.
Contrast between the logic of history (technological determinism is irrational) vs. the lived
experience (which often feels deterministic).
Cultures of technology: engineering, organization. (Mindell and Hughes both use this word,
cultures.)

Response to technological innovation seen in the arts: the Armory Show on the eve of WWI
The Chicago Exposition: the Turner thesis, marked a turning point in many fields
The Education of Henry Adams, “The Dynamo and the Virgin”
• a great binary conception: production vs. reproduction
• view of history (spurious, yet interesting)

Appian, Civil Wars 1.57
When Sulla heard of this he resolved to decide
the question by war, and called the army together to a
conference. They were eager for the war against
Mithridates because it promised much plunder, and they
feared that Marius would enlist other soldiers instead of
themselves. Sulla spoke of the indignity put upon him by
Sulpicius and Marius, and while he did not openly allude
to anything else (for he did not dare as yet to mention
this sort of war), he urged them to be ready to obey his
orders. They understood what he meant, and as they
feared lest they should miss the campaign they uttered
boldly what Sulla had in mind, and told him to be of good
courage, and to lead them to Rome…

Appian, Civil Wars 1.57
Sulla was overjoyed and led six legions thither
forthwith; but all his superior officers, except one
quaestor, left him and fled to the city, because they
would not submit to the idea of leading an army against
their country. Envoys met him on the road and asked
him why he was marching with armed forces against his
country. “To deliver her from tyrants,” he replied.

Fall 2004
For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
"Reading Notes on David Christian, Maps of Time, Chapter 13, “Birth of the Modern World”
To begin with terminology: Christian refers to the “Modern Revolution” that has transformed the
world in the last 250 years. How is the Modern Revolution a more encompassing concept than
what is usually called the Industrial Revolution? What other types of changes does it include
besides economic ones? (See p. 437, as well as the overall organization of this chapter.)
According to Christian, is industrialization the material “substructure” of the other elements of
the Modern Revolution? (409)
Why does Christian believe that the economic changes associated with industrialization deserve
to be called revolutionary? (410-411; also tables on pp. 407-09)
Take some time to look at the tables on pp. 407-409. What are some things you notice about
them? How is this a different way of representing history in symbolic form than the “chart of
civilizations” we studied in our first class meeting?
What is the geography of industrialization and modernity: are they regional (Western European)
or global or both? (409-410) What are some examples of the “soft power” of now-global
modernity? (410) Why does Christian turn to Britain to trace the early stages on
industrialization? (411) What economic factors besides industrialization were involved in the
British economic revolution? (411-412)
What does Christian mean by Britain’s “pre-adaption” as a commercial society? Do you consider
this a sufficient explanation of the role of cultural history in the British Industrial Revolution? Is
it compatible with Margaret Jacobs’ analysis of the scientific roots of industrialization? (412-13)
How was British agriculture transformed by commercial capitalism in the centuries preceding the
Industrial Revolution? We recently discussed “the tragedy of the commons” in connection with
the challenges of managing commonly-owned land and other resources. How were commonly
held lands dealt with in Britain in the years preceding and during the Industrial Revolution?
(414-415)
Note that Christian typically describes social inequalities with the metaphor of “gradient” rather
than in the concept of class. What do you think of this metaphor as he uses it to describe the new
inequalities that came with the Modern Revolution in agriculture? (415; see also 428-29 for his
discussion of the role of the state in maintaining social inequality) You might look back to his
description of the much earlier “gradient of wealth and power in large agrarian communities” for
purposes of comparison/contrast. (264-267)
What are some ways that British agriculturists raised productivity significantly without striking
innovations in machinery or chemistry? (416-17)
What changes in the marketing of agricultural goods intensified the changes in land ownership
and management? How does Christian summarize four social and commercial changes that “pre-
adapted” Britain for a leading role in industrialization? (417-18)

In these industrial changes, trace the intertwining roles of new energy sources, mechanization of
production, and new management techniques (419-21)
On pp. 422-23 Christian presents a traditional account of the technical core of the Industrial
Revolution (especially the figures, showing Watt’s crucial inventions). On pp. 423-26 he
presents a less traditional account of the wave of innovation, which emphasizes the role of
anonymous artisanal skills and also the general shaping forces of global capitalism. Do you find
these accounts compatible or conflicting? Does the discussion of the relationship between what
we now call “science” and “technology” in early industrialization seem compatible with what we
learned about the French Encyclopedie edited by Diderot and d’Alembert? (424)
What is the relationship between political and economic revolutions? More specifically, what
new roles for the state, and sources of power for the state, emerged in the l8th and l9th centuries?
How does the modern state try to balance regulation and support of its citizens? Of economic
activity in general? (426-30)
What is the role of warfare in the transformation of state power? (426-29) Note in particular
references to the American Civil War as the first “industrialized” war (429, 434), as this will be
the topic of Prof. Smith’s presentation in our next class.
Christian returns to the theme of the relationship between “science” and “technology” in his
discussion of the cultural revolution associated with industrialization. How does he describe and
explain “Science’s grip on modern culture”? (432) Does he assume this means a decline in the
“grip” of religious faith? What other cultural changes does he emphasize? (430-32; also 438)
What are some limitations and reservations what Christian acknowledges regarding the term
“revolution”? (432) Despite them, how did the Modern Revolution sweep around the globe from
its origins in Western Europe? What are some of the major waves in this process? (433-35)
What were the overall effects of this global transformation on other parts of the world? When
and how did the so-called Third World appear? How does its appearance modify prevailing
concepts of historical progress? How does the “gradient” of inequality within states become
played out as a gradient among them?(435-36; 438)
What are some new forms of industrial organization emerging in the l9th century? How do they
suggest a possible blurring of the roles of economic and political powers? (434) What is the
paradox of economic development when it is undertaken by a “traditional” tributary state? (436-
37)

If you think of “technology” as industrial production, it seems off topic
“ecosystem engineers” – why I handed it out – a reminder of the varieties of engineering
Agriculture as an entirely new way of interacting with flora and fauna of the world for human
ends, productive and reproductive
“bioengineering” – not just genetics but redoing agricultural production – green revolution – GM
foods – animal breeding and cloning (Dolly) (we will get back to this at the end of class)
Also though engineering not as production of goods but production of space – a humanbuilt
world – civil engineering – along with military engineering, oldest branch
Organization of space through creation of pathways and centers – bridges and dwellings
(Heidegger) – “second nature”
Machines vs structures: Billington has complained about bias of engineering history on former,
not latter, which are highly visible, massive, relatively permanent, slow to evole, and site-
specific -
Agriculture is both: food production and shaping the world
Seismic scale of revolutions: this is the big one, should be the standard against which to measure
Everything changed: physical health: organization of society: gender relations: ideas?
And still a mystery – so many elements – so many trade-offs
Cutting edge: How knowledge and perspectives keep changing – research ongoing
Basic questions: how revolutionary was it? Certainly in results, but how sudden?

Changes since then: a gradual economic transformation, most communities not pristine hunter-
gatherers nor full-fledged farmers – ec evolution not cultural revolution – most people hunter-
gatherers-cultivators
The story of agri is much more complicated and interesting than had been imagined
A long and winding road
“people were messing with plants for a very long time”
Sequence theory: domestication, then sedentism
Now: Sequence: sedentary life came before plant domestication; then animal herding and use of
pottery – in Near East
Not so in Americas
e.g. Mexico, squash and maize/corn domesticated while people were still completely mobile, not
sedentary
Also, dissemination (note word) or independent discovery?
Diffusion theory
Now , simultaneous invention of agr. ca. 11.5 BP
Mithen’s talk last spring
“One of the most astonishing features of human history is that agricultural economics arose quite
independently during the early Holocene in several different regions of the world.” (Mithen 49)
Science handout
Look at map in Science article
His conclusion: there is “immense variety of pathways that led to farming in different parts of the
world”
e.g. in North Africa animals domesticated before plants
e.g. in China pottery invented along with domestication of rice, but long before farming and
sedentism in Japan
e.g. cereal farming spread rapidly from China and Western Asia
2

whereas roots, tubers, vegetables in New Guinea and Central America remained localized
e.g. Australia remained hunter-gatherers until whites arrive
e.g.mystery how indigenous African plants became domesticated
Mithen: three requirements: not just end of ice ages (After the Ice)
Climate – distinct increase in temp and rainfall that begins the Holocene (11.5 BP)
Environmental resources
Mind: fluid, imaginative mentality of modern humans
Western Asia has by the the most and best quality evidence (climate)
Kathleen Kenyon at Jericho in 1950s –
See: http://www.archaeowiki.org/Kathleen_Kenyon
Near Jordan river on West Bank – well below sea level (820 feet, 250 M) – east west route north
of the Dead Sea – near current town by that name
See: http://www.archatlas.dept.shef.ac.uk/OriginsFarming/Colledge/Slide18.jpg
Near salt and flint trade routes
One of the oldest human habitations
Importance of methodical excavations – many layers
found mud-brick circular dwellings; cultivate wheat and barley on allurvial soils of Jordan
Valley? Probably collected wild seeds rather than planting them – scythes with flint edges and
bone handles; stone mortars to grind seeds
but no ceramics/pottery (PPNA: pre-pottery Neolithic A) – round huts Mudbricks – not fired but
dried in sun – clay, mud, and water mixed with a binding material such as straw, or rice husks -
combined hunting and gathering with crops – also burial customs: secondary (exhume skulls of
the dead, maybe display for a while, then rebury)
“type site” settlement – a couple thousand
See: http://www.biblearchaeology.org/image.axd?picture=Life-on-the-Edge-WEB.jpg
Walls – 2 meters wide – huge tower 9 meters in diameter - large tower – granary? (not Joshua’s
tower) – storage bins of stone or mud-brick – not evidence of serious warfare then – protect salt?
See: http://www.archaeology.org/online/reviews/kenyon/thumbnails/kenyon6.gif

Interesting proposal: building makes people settle not the reverse (we’ll return to this)
See: http://www.bible-architecture.info/Jerich4.jpg
Typical tools – “lithic” industry (blades) – flint – striking a long narrow flake from a stone core –
also sickles (gather while you cut) and arrowheads – axes or adzes, to smooth wood – hatchets or
axes to cut wood – weave mats – spears, flint-tipped arrows
Others found in West Bank area, but Jericho seemed unique
See: http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/images//5188-9.jpg
See: http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Pre-Pottery_Neolithic
More recently similar sites in in southern Jordan – to the south – more recently to the north in
Syria and Turkey – these are villages in Lowlands – PPNA more widespread than had been
believed
Key questions concerning the extent to which wild plants were cultivated and animals managed,
whether communities were mobile or sedentary, and the nature of cultural developments remain
unanswered.

Found circular dwellings stone technologies– working reeds, wood, hide, stone – seem to have
made clothing, traps, cages, stone beads, wood artefacts, maybe goat pens
Also animal bones, wild goat, surprisingly small, a sign of domestication, rather than wild flocks,
or some partial domestication

secondary burials

skeletons, see: http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/finlayson319
And acceleration of change: emergence of different time scales - in “B” there were two-story
multi-roomed rectangular buildings, with polished lime floor – houses 7 meters by 7 meters –
ceiling ot reeds and mud (ca 5500 BCE)
Pottery comes – rough, primitive, geometrical figures – 4000 to 5000 BCE
Then Bronze age sometime in 3000 BCE (copper; walls; Bedouin raiders)
Now we are back to map we started with
Cities, states, “civilization,” all the British Museum stuff….
Progress? “civilization and its discontents” – defending territory; health; economic surplus
leading to social differentiation
Christian assumes a long period before this happened
Now not so clear: Gobekli Tepe in southeast Turkey discovered in 1960s
See: http://www.viewzone.com/g.geography.jpg
In the hills not lowlands – a limestone hill, 300 m in diameter, ca. 15 m high, with round-topped
knolls on it (“hill with a potbelly” in Kurdish)
Would be a lovely view: rivers, animals, trees, fields, mild climate, arable land…
See: http://media.smithsonianmag.com/images/gobeklitepe_nov08_631.jpg
5000 years older than Troy (found in late l9th c)
About same time circular dwellings of Jericho were being built, ca 9600 BC – people carved T-
shaped pillars out of limestone bedrock – 8 ft high, 7 tons, within circular buildings sunk into the
hill -
One acre excavation only 5% of site
Circles range from 30 to 100 feet in diameter, surrounded by stone walls about 6 feet high –
5

Many layers –top one shows agricultural activity – one below that is PPNB (7500-6000 BC)
surveys (ground penetrating radar, geomagnetic surverys) suggest 16 more structures/rings yet
to be unearthed under 22 acres – upper levels are less large, some rectangular structures - the
earlier you go down the more monumental they are - suggest several millennia of activity -
carved to display wild animals, typically dangerous ones: lions, ducks, scorpions, ants, spiders,
snakes, vulture, boar - one with human arm –
staggering labor – flint flakes all over, from tools used to carve the stone, which was in soft
limestone outcrops - could shape them into pillars there, carry them a few hundred yards to the
summit, lift them upright – source was several km away – no metal tools, no pottery
No hearths, no trash heaps, no houses, no clay fertility figures – Instead, lots of gazelle bones (60
% total) People who relied on wild game and plants – nothing domesticated, no domestic
buildings – had to be a ritual center – another similar site in Syria, with similar symbols – also
similar to a Neolithic site in central Turkey
“First came the temple, then the city”
Networking center? Hunter gatherers came to council?
Maybe wheat was domesticated to provide sufficient food for those who worked and gathered in
Gobekli Tepe, and when people dispersed back to villages, maybe they took seed grain with
them – so maybe wheat was not domesticated as result of struggle vs. harsh climate before global
warming at 9600 BC: maybe a by-product of ritual gatherings in southern Turkey
For images, see: http://www.viewzone.com/turkeyx.html
http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/gobekli-tepe.html#
http://www.philipcoppens.com/gobekli.html
Apparently when rings were done, the early Neolithic peoples deliberately buried these ritual
buildings below several tons of soil – and then placed another ring near or on top of the old one
See: http://www.philipcoppens.com/gobekli_5.jpg
So ideology went hand in hand with changes in the economy
Right on the edge: had wild sheep and wild grains
Within 1000 years, sheep, cattle and pigs had been corralled –
Just 500 years later there is evidence of domesticated strains of wheat
“Sociocultural change comes first, agri comes later”
So what is going on? Fragments of human bone in layers of dirt – floors of rings are hardened
limestone – Burial ground, death cult?

Stone circles are familiar – but this one is about 7000 years before Stonehenge was built
More time separates these two structures than separates Stonehenge from us

Discussion of Readings and Papers
Chihyung’s Paper
• “The question is: For whom would the engineers work?”
• What do we mean by a “class”? In what sense are engineers a “class”?
– The way in which they participate in production?
– For Marx, a class is: a group of people who have a particular relation to the productive
system.
• Engineers −→ managers
• Mediating the role between laborers and financiers? Not a clear relationship to production.
• Hands or mind as a marker of class! Where does the engineer’s paycheck come from?
– Consciousness
– For whom do you work?
– What type of work do you do?
• Time period where professionalization was happening across the board, in all professions.
• Why are Veblen’s engineers hostile to commercial value? Efficiency, rationality. Emphasis
on method. Mindset inculcated by education.
• Where are the professional boundaries?
• How does Noble see the engineers as, um, not so noble as Veblen does? −→ He sees them
as the lackeys of capitalism, rather than as the adversaries of capitalism.
Laura’s Paper
• Engineering and responsibility
• The aesthetic side
• Architecture vs. engineering
• Elite vs. greater good
• Functionalism
• The sublime
• Roland Barthes, Mythologies −→ myth as a second­order language −→ technology as
myth?

Emina’s Paper
• “process” and “engineer”
• The thought process of engineering as what defines it −→ “not what to think, but how to
think”
• Cybernetics, Norbert Wiener −→ processes common to organic and mechanical systems,
feedback, control, communication −→ a vision of human relations with machines
• Veblen −→ habituation of people to machines changes the way people think

Born 1882 on Spring Garden Farm, Laurel Delaware, bought by his seafaring grandfather
in 1813, 400 acres, prosperous
His grandfather was one of 21 children; for every one that survived (7), two died – 3
wives
His father named Henry Clay after “the Great Emancipator,” saw troops returning from
Harpers Ferry in 1860, Republican, abolitionist yet family owned slaves (let them buy
their freedom)
Why I mention these things: history of technology is part of much larger human history
longer cycles, deeper changes more important than anything we typically think of as
“tech. innovation”
e.g. longevity, mortality esp. of women and children
e.g. impact of war – more killed in Civil War than all other US wars combined
e.g. great moral and social issue of slavery
all related to “technology” (medicine, weapons, productivity of labor) but not easily
reducible to material change – deep historical question is relation between material and
other types of change(social, intellectual, cultural)

Diary from winter of 1898 –little details that remind us of what is now called the Second
Industrial Revolution – most concentrated period of changes in daily life, made everyday
life far more comfortable and interesting than ever before
Post in 1997: The late l9th c was the greatest period of tech’l change in terms of things
that affected huge numbers of people’s lives in basic ways—much more so than today.”
Distinctive contributions were distribiution of cheap and flexible energy in the form of
electricity, construction of layer of grids of communication and transportation (subways,
automobiles, telephone, radio), and democratization of luxury through proliferation of
cheaper and more varied consumer goods
Thursday Jan 12
After school I went up to Lasell and read Cicero with Cousin Mary, and then she gave
me a supper of canned chicken, cocoa, bread, butter, crackers and peanut butter. I had a
fine time. (globalized systems already, industrialized food)
home – “four factories were going up in Laurel and vicinity for canning, he is going to
put out 10 acres of tomatoes, he has only four cows now” (those railroads)
Shopping not making – more food
Today as I was walking home from school, Cousin Mary, in the electrics, saw me, got out
and walked home with me. Then we went into Boston. I got my coat; she bought two tin
basins, a pie pan, a strainer and a dozen knives and forks. She carried in a mug strainer
belonging to a coffee pot, to fit the strainer she bought to it. –
Large technological systems, street car suburbs – progress defined as their extension –
and as improvements in material comfort through low-cost production for mass use –
Feb.24 “Yesterday afternoon I went up to Auburndale. It seems Cousin Mary telephoned
me not to go. I forgot it. She was down in Newtonville waiting for me and we just
missed. She went to Newton. But we could hear from each other now, by telephone. I
started for Newton. She got on the train there and we went into Boston and saw the new
pictures by ? in the Art Museum. They were very good—especially those of Joan of Arc.
Transportation: I went down town in the evening and rode. I asked a man passing for a
ride and he consented; it was the first time I’ve ridden on or behind a horse since last
Sept., and I a farmer’s boy.

information age
Postal system -Regularly exchanged letters from home
A lot of reading – not just Cicero and Shakespeare for school but Treasure Island for fun–
go to library frequently, have a card
Magazines – Advocates, also one from home – articles on South Africa
Church, glee club performances at Lasell, Fremont Temple lecture, play about the pied
piper with little boys as rats, performance of As you like it
Trip to Museum of Fine Arts – drawing class in school, discussing modern illustrators
like Pyle – starts looking for their works everywhere – Cousin Mary gives him many
pictures by them – read lives of the illustrators - doing mechanical drawing
This too is an information age, full of it, not esp. privileged in terms of money
(schoolteacher, farm kid paying room and board) – very different culture but that is the
key difference not lack of info.

lecture was a fine one in favor of staying to help them learn to govern themselves.” Goes
to another lecture a week later, same topic, another speaker: “He made some good points
but as Cousin Mary said some bad ones. He attacked Dr. Abbott, saying he made some
misstatements concerning the arguments on Californian annexation, and made McKinley
out as having imperial power….Cousin Mary is on his side but I can’t say I am.”

Slide 16
MIT in 1901, when he entered
Word “technology” still unusual
Entered to study mechanical engineering - still dominant along with civil, the oldest
organized engineering organization, and military engineering, oldest of all
But two new types of engineering emerging, electrical and chemical
Engineering not a stable profession – meaning of this term has changed dramatically over
the centuries
In both cases great expansion of knowledge base mainly from scientific research
industrial processes involving chemistry go back to antiquity: brewing, bleaches and
organic dyes, ceramics, sugar, glass-making, soap-making, tanning, paper-making –
largely batch processes, small-scale, divorced from any scientific knowledge
great expansion of chemical knowledge base in 19th c. was crucial in development of
large-scale chemical industries – classic case, 150 years ago, William Perkin’s discovery
of mauve, made from coal tar, followed by discovery of structure of benzene molecule
(Kekule 1865) synthetic organic chemistry opened up possibility of many more dyestuffs
fine chemists from German universities, but looked at problems from point of view of
laboratory worker, thinking of themselves as industrial or applied chemists specializing in
a specific industry; left details of equipment construction to mechanical engineers, who
had little or no understanding of the chemical processes –in WKL’s words “There was an
4

iron curtain between chemistry and engineering.” (Evolution, 1) – had to do with social
class
WKL entered MIT just at the moment of the emergence of chemical engineering as a
distinctive professional identity around 1890s through early 1920s (7000 chem eng
students nationally, definitive text Principles of ChemEng 1923 by Walker, Lewis,
McAdams)
Slide 17 – industrial chemistry lab 1893 MIT
not an applied chemist but an engineer, not a specialist in a particular industry but “a
member of a great professional group united by the possession of common skills and
activities” (WKL, Evolution, 1) –
“The stimulus of these concepts made work in chem. Eng at the Institute from 1902 to
the outbreak of WWI an inspiration for both staff and student which it is impossible to
describe.”
But also a time of tensions
Engineering always working on two fronts – science and business
Always in danger of losing turf battles to either or both
MIT story is especially interesting because two strong individuals represented these two
pulls
Slide 18
Arthur Amos Noyes, trained in Germany, physical chemist, began teaching one of the
earliest and strongest p chem. Programs in the country – this became part of the chemical
engineering curriculum in 1902: “There was to be no iron curtain between chemistry and
engineering at MIT” (Evolution, 6)
Eng. science not a post WW II invention – much earlier – solid scientific basis, but not
physics as with mech eng.
But Noyes as a chemist continued to see chemical eng. from the perspective of the
research lab
Slide 19
Industrial connections stressed by William H. Walker, Penn State and Gottingen, was
teaching analytical chemistry, at MIT since 1890 – partner of AD Little in consulting
practice to apply physics and chemistry to industry – returned to MIT, entrusted with
Course X in 1903, part of chemistry dept.
Walker in 1934: Slide 20
But not a matter of giving industry what it wants: instead, looking ahead to problems not
even imagined at the time
5

What an industry needed was not a man who had been taught what that industry already
knew, but rather a man who was trained to do what the industry had not been able to
do…the ideal man for the industries was one who had been given a sound knowledge of
chemistry and physics, and then as a part of the curriculum had been given systematic
experience in the application of this knowledge to the solution of industrial problems;
that he should not be a specialist but a solver of problems—any kind of problem that
industry might present. This idea met opposition both from established courses of
chemical instruction and from industry.
“To prove the soundness of this idea I returned to MIT in 1903 and after a hot fight with
both the chemical and the engineering faculties I reconstructioned Course X as a general
educational course without options.”
Cut out foundry practice, introduced and required p chem., strengthened organic and
advanced inorganic chemistry – to get students to understand fundamental mechanisms of
what was going on
WKL (evo. 6) – fall 0f 1904, quiz in p chem. Under Walker: “If pure ice and pure salt,
both at -10 degrees C., be brought together, what happens? Exactly how does it happen,
i.e. what is the mechanism by which it happens?”

returning to US 1908 for a year or two or work in industry (tannery) – then to MIT
Slide 23
By 1909 more degrees in chem. Eng than in chemistry (two to one between 1909-14)
Tremendous demand in WWI
Walker was put in charge of Edgewood Arsenal, to synthesize toxic gases,
“manufacturing new products by processes that were likewise almost wholly new”
250 officers and 7000 men– WKL in charge of gas mask design, the masks in the
basement of his Newton home
Not just war demand, also need to develop domestic industry to substitute for non-
available imports
Tension continued at MIT
Noyes more traditional lab chemistry approach became more and more marginal
under pressure from Walker, Noyes left in 1919 to become president of Cal Tech (Servos
533) –
6

Walker left too - concept of internship, promoted by Little, took shape as School of
Engineering Practice (internships in US industries in cement, dyes, gas and coke,, etc.)
– had plan for division of industrial coop and research, helped raise endowment,
industrially sponsored research, led to complaints about quality of work done under this
plan –
President Maclaurin died, “the development of the idea became impossible and I dropped
out of educational work”
Slide 24
1921 Course X became separate dept., Lewis as head – worked closely with petroleum
industry, fluidized bed catalytic cracking
Summary
Male
Crucial input of new knowledge base
being educated to work with industry but with long view (value of eng. sci)
purpose of industry is low-cost production for mass market –
WKL when he went to grad school in Breslau, a great industrial city of Germany: “I saw
the piling for the foundations of a new, large, modern business building driven by
workmen on the ends of a cat-o’-nine tails; in this country I had never seen such work
done other than by a donkey engine, even on construction in backwoods areas. America
had to keep costs down by every practicable device to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of human labor. Mass production was the solution of the problem.”(new
science, 9)
Stimulus of war too
Engineering today: general decline
Mass production cheaply: this has been outsourced – where will jobs come from?
Innovation serves economy not people
National security? But the systems we build have become a source of insecurity (ever
since gas warfare: “instant conversion” from civilian to military purposes
Health care? 14% of US GNP, unaffordable, corrupted by conflict of interest
Environmental costs of technological progress
Not so obvious what progress means: or rather technological progress doesn’t necessarily
mean historical progress
Back to Laurel: photo was from selling the farm in 1952
What changed wasn’t the farm/farming but the whole “surround”
Tomatoes from California and hothouses
The Dual (Rt. 13) going in in forties to connect Wilmington with Seaford – DuPont plant
there opened to make nylon (1939)
7

Bay Bridge opened it up to vacation homes
on Ntl Register,, had been B&B, barn as antiques shop
Chemical eng. brought not improvement of a beloved way of life, but a whole other way
of life – a much better world but not the one he loved – as true for engineers as for
everyone else: not just improving nature, but replacing it with another environment
Slide 37: Morison
Slide 38: not just human imprint on world
Technology making possible formerly unallowable processes and events, or at least not
on this earth
Climate change: release of fossil fuels (for so long the dominant form of chem. Eng) –
possible non-linear effects, a vast open air experiment, “risk society”
Biological engineering – new organisms, modes of reproduction
Nuclear energy – WKL’s work during WWII, his fears,
Lots of action, few controls; innovation without boundaries; space of action keeps
expanding and getting beyond ability to control
Not right-left, not Luddism, not nostalgia, not utopianism
Nor is it a matter of engineering anymore – engineers solve problems, but the problems
of humanity are larger than engineering: are of civilization in a self-created habitat
Slide 39
Deeply integrated approach is needed
WKL’s conclusion: wanting to come back as a social scientist
the engineer alone can have the breadth of understanding of the industrial situation which
will be needed to furnish leadership in the future. The educational leaders of this
generation will rise to the challenge as did the leaders in the chem eng field a half century
and more ago.”(Evo 8)

Digest
Ulpian, 9.3.5.1-2
If the apartment is divided among several tenants, redress
can be sought only against that one of them who lives in that
part of the apartment from the level of which the liquid has
been poured. If the tenant, however, while professing to
have sublet, has in fact retained for himself the enjoyment of
the greater part of the apartment, he shall be held solely
responsible. If, on the other hand, the tenant who professes
to have sublet has in fact retained for his own use only a
modest fraction of the space, he and his sub-tenants shall
be jointly held responsible. The same will hold good if the
vessel or the liquid has been thrown from a balcony.

Crassus
Plutarch, 2
And besides this, observing how natural and
familiar at Rome were such fatalities as the
conflagration and collapse of buildings, owing to
their being too massive and close together, he
proceeded to buy slaves who were architects and
builders. Then, when he had over five hundred of
these, he would buy houses that were afire, and
houses which adjoined those that were afire, and
these their owners would let go at a trifling price
owing to their fear and uncertainty.

"Questions on Christian, Chapter 10, “Long Trends in the Era of Agrarian ‘Civilizations’”
This is a long and rich chapter. As usual, Christian is unusually interested in why events happen.
In the first half of this chapter, he focuses on geographical explanations; in the second, on
economic explanations, defining it as “the collective human capacity to manipulate the natural
environment” (283). In both cases he is looking for large structural changes—population growth,
productivity, collective learning and innovation--rather than than detailed sequences of political
succession.
While you are reading, then, try to link Christian’s analysis with the historical sequence of events
that is probably more familiar to you. For example, in this chapter he covers Egypt under the
Pharoahs, Greece of the Bronze Age, and the Roman Empire (all familiar in “Western Civ”
courses) as all part of the 4000+- year chunk of time he is considering (see e.g. p. 298). He
stresses that the emergence of large-scale, diverse agriculture-based states he is describing took
place not only in the Middle East but also in other “world zones,” most notably Mesoamerica,
approximately 2000 years later.
Nevertheless, Christian repeatedly sounds the theme of the dominance in world history of the
great junction point, the “center of gravity,” where Africa, Europe, and Asia connect—the “Afro-
Eurasian world zone” (295), or what we typically and vaguely refer to today as “the Middle
East.” Therefore he is going to need to explain how modern industry developed in other sites in
the modern age—the rise of Europe as the site of the Industrial Revolution, the dominance of the
US in the twentieth century, and the emerging dominance of China in the 21st century. Keep your
eyes open for how he deals with these issues. (Christian himself mentions this “displacement” of
the Afro-Eurasia hub from its central role in world history on p. 296.)
Be sure you understand the overall trends of agrarian civilizations in the era ca.3200 BCE to
1400 CE (or ca. 5000-1000 BP). (Note that the “map of time” we looked at in our first class
*began* the story of history at 5000 BP, while for Christian this date comes about halfway
through his historical account.) What are their dominant characteristics? (289) What other types
of societies exist during this era and where did they prevail? (284-6) How are agrarian
civilizations distinct, and why are they worth special attention, especially in terms of the theme
“technology in history”? (286, 293) What is the overall evolution of the balance between
agrarian civilizations and other forms of society in this period? (293-94) Describe the overall
expansion of agrarian civilizations in this period in terms of territorial domination. Compare the
control over population of these civilizations with that of modern capitalist states (302-05; 317).
Much of the story of technology in recent history is written as an account of Famous Inventors,
Famous Industrialists, etc. How is Christian’s account written in the spirit of “history from
below”? (287) How does he account for male authority (patriarchal claims) in this period? (287)
What is a “tribute-taking” society, and how does it differ from a “gift-giving” society? How does
power based on consent differ from power based on coercion? What do you think of McNeill’s
analogy with parasitism (which Christian cites approvingly)? (287-88) Do these concepts help
you understand contemporary societies and states?

What are “world-systems? (The question of European dominance begins to be discussed here.)
What are four kinds of networks of power and influence? Think about which technologies are
distinctively associated with each kind of network. (289-91)
Once again, what do you think of Christian’s scientific analogies—e.g. laws of gravity and social
centers of gravity, and the deformation of space-time by large bodies? What are hub regions and
how do they differ from centers of gravity? (291-93) Is he “reifying” geography when he writes
that “Both centers of gravity and hub regions powerfully shaped change….?” Is this geographical
determinism? If so, how might it relate to technological determinism?
How separate were the various world zones during this 4-millennia period? (297-98, 301) When
and how did India emerge as a new center of gravity? (299) When did agricultural civilization
expand to south China, southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe? (300) to eastern Europe
up to the Urals and to West Africa? (301) when did agricultural civilization emerge in
Mesoamerica? (301) When the encounter with Europe took place in the 16th century, what
agricultural civilizations existed in the Americas? (302-4) How did the American world system
at that time compare with that of Afro-Eurasia? (304, 318; also map p. 314)
Now Christian turns his attention to the themes of intensification (as opposed to
“extensification”), innovation, growth, commercialization, and urbanization—in other words,
processes now usually referred to as “economic.”
How is scale a source of innovation? What are major innovations in transportation in this period,
and how do they related to the “secondary products revolution” Christian described in Chapter 9,
pp. 255-57? (306-8) What are major innovations in information communication? (307-8)
What are the long-term patterns of population growth in the early agrarian era? How did
population growth and technological change interact in what was ultimately a negative feedback
cycle? What is the analysis of Malthus about population growth? What is population
“overshoot”? What are Malthusian cycles? (308-12, 331-32)
What are the ecological components of the interactions of population and technologies? Does
Christian’s discussion alter in any way your understanding of your reading in Diamond’s
Collapse?
What is the role of epidemic disease in the cycles of population and technological change? What
are some explanations for the growth of population in Eurasia in the first millennium BCE and
for the population downturn in the first millennium CE? (312-16) What are some other causes of
major population decline? (316)
How do states and cities stimulate innovation? How do they dampen it? What is the mixed effect
of military activity on innovation and accumulation? Of large urban projects? How does the
widespread distribution of property inhibit innovation? What are the implications of this
relationship for early modern history?(316, 319-324) Where and why did some peasants engage
in productivity-raising innovation? (328-29)
How might the dominance of large agricultural civilizations relate to the emergence of universal
religions? (319) To a social hierarchy dominated by male warrior values and lifeways and lack of

interaction between this elite and productive work or commercial transactions? (322-25, 328,
220)
What is the role of commercial exchange in promoting innovation and accumulation? What is the
relationship of these exchanges to tributary methods? (326-220) To city-founding and –building?
(324-26, including table on p. 326) What are some examples of small but vigorous states based
on trade? (327, 329-330) When did coinage appear? (328)
Christian summarizes the contradictory results of population growth, increasing state power, and
increasing commercialization on innovation and growth of wealth in agrarian civilizations. How
does he explain the overall result of sluggish growth? (330-331)

Reading Nietzsche in Swann's Way and To the Lighthouse
In The Will to Power Nietzsche describes the difference between what he calls the
Dionysian and Apollonian ways of understanding the reality of the world:
Apollo's deception: the eternity of beautiful form; the aristocratic
legislation, “thus shall it be for ever!”
Dionysus: sensuality and cruelty. Transitoriness could be interpreted as
enjoyment of productive and destructive force, as continual creation. (The Will to
Power, 1049)
This passage illustrates Nietzsche's understanding of time as an essential element in the
individual's relationship to the universe. Nietzsche understands the Apollonian mode as
performing a conflation of beauty and immortality, suggested by his situating the phrase that
describes the relationship between the two entities, “the eternity of beautiful form,” in a mere
sentence fragment that entirely avoids suggesting the sort of cause and effect relationship (that is,
a relationship by which eternity comes about logically through or because of beauty, or vice
versa) that one usually uses in making aesthetic or moral judgments. Nietzsche's description of
the relationship between beauty and immortality as “aristocratic” suggests his belief that this
relationship is an arbitrary and false relationship enforced not by nature but by human authority.
The relationship between beauty and immortality is of course quite complicated, as the
notion of form suggests. Form, in a sense, can be understood as beauty (or aesthetic judgment)
extended across time. Form compares objects with one another; it comes out of the similarities
and differences that can be noted among objects and it essentially reduces the multiplicity of
individual entities and objects into a single trait. The beauty of an object perishes along with that

object; the beauty of a form, in contrast, exists across history, such that the beauty of the human
body today can be understood as the very same beauty that the first human body possessed. It is
a static and single beauty. To speak of the beauty of a body is to speak essentially of all bodies
and thus no individual body at all.
Importantly, the Apollonian concept of meaning extends beyond “beauty” to include any
quality by which an object might be defined in comparison with other objects and experiences.
Nietzsche's choice to use “beauty”can be understood as somewhat arbitrary, since it is not the
specific quality under consideration but rather the way in which that quality becomes meaningful
that is important in Nietzsche's discussion.
In contrast with the Apollonian, which defines meaning by extension forwards and
backwards through time, to Nietzsche the Dionysian mode comes about through the recognition
of the temporality of objects and meanings. Transitoriness, the inevitable yielding of all things to
time, is the result of a “productive and destructive force”-- destructive in that objects of the past
are lost but productive in that it is only through the very loss of the past that the future can come
about. Nietzsche locates within the Dionysian process of continual destruction and rebirth an
eternal reality to replace the Apollonian “deception” of eternal beauty: “the eternal will to
procreation, to fruitfulness, to recurrence; the feeling of the necessary unity of creation and
destruction” (The Will to Power, 1050). In a sense we can understand the Apollonian mode as
being concerned with the preservation of a quality (such as beauty) along the axis of time and as
willing to sacrifice the uniqueness of each object in the interest of preservation; likewise, we can
understand the Dionysian mode as being concerned with the opposite function, a function that
eliminates the uniqueness of the discrete historical moment-- essentially reducing all moments in
time into a single endless moment, “the abyss of transitoriness”-- in order to explore and expand

the limitless, unique qualities of the objects that occupy it. Thus in Dionysian thought,
meaningful relationships between objects are based on their shared presence in the moment and
their shared interactions with the force of change that both generates and destroys.
Interestingly, and somewhat counterintuitively, Nietzsche's descriptions of these modes of
thought reveal how the Apollonian effort to preserve meaning across time has the destructive
effect of eliminating individual meaning, while the Dionysian embrace of the very transitoriness
of the object and the moment opens up a wealth of new meanings based on an exploration of the
ways in which these objects navigate the force of change.
Our readings of Proust and Woolf, because of the concern in their work for locating the
meanings of objects and experiences as they relate to the inevitable passing of time, can be
informed by Nietzsche's writings on the Dionysian and the Appollonian.
The first section of To the Lighthouse, entitled “The Window,” explores the thoughts and
experiences of various characters, paying close attention to the ways in which the characters
derive satisfaction and meaning from their experiences in relation to one another. In the
following passage, for example, Lily Briscoe and William Bankes share the experience of
watching a boat on the water:
They both felt a common hilarity, excited by the moving waves; and then
by the swift cutting race of a sailing boat, which, having sliced a curve in the bay,
stopped; shivered; let its sails drop down; and then, with a natural instinct to
complete the picture, after this swift movement, both of them looked at the dunes
far away, and instead of merriment felt come over them some sadness-- because
the thing was completed partly, and partly because distant views seem to outlast

by a million years (Lily thought) the gazer and to be communing already with a
sky which beholds an earth entirely at rest. (To the Lighthouse, p. 34)
There are several layers of meaning working in this passage. There are, of course, the
phenomena that the characters witness, the ocean waves, the sailboat, the dunes, all of which
seem to exist in an objective reality. Also present are the subjective emotional experiences that
these phenomena incite within the characters, namely, joy by the waves and the boat, and shortly
thereafter sadness by the quiet landscape; this level of meaning exists within an individual
character. Additionally, there is a way in which the comparison of the subjective experiences of
the individual characters generates another level of meaning-- they feel a “common hilarity” and
perform actions of response in unison (“both of them looked at the dunes far away”). The
suggestion of two characters experiencing identical emotions extends, in a sense, the significance
of the emotion from being contained within a single character's subjectivity to being a part of the
experience of the universal human experience. At first this effect of broadening and
universalizing the human emotional experience seems to be the most significant effect of the
passage-- the general insularity of the characters' narration in To the Lighthouse has the effect of
creating a sense of personal isolation that infrequent moments of genuine connection tend to
relieve-- however, Lily's thoughts at the end of the passage have somewhat of the opposite effect
in that they question the very value of human meaning in the first place.
Lily notices the absurdity of the fact that human beings tend to prioritize the meanings
they provide or generate in relation to nature over nature itself despite nature's certainty to outlast
humanity. She recognizes that, despite the seeming simplicity of the inherent meanings of the
waves or the dunes (specifically, that they are not meaningful at all but merely exist beyond
question or purpose) in comparison to the complex human meanings that are situated in societal,

psychological, or philosophical systems, these inherent meanings are in fact far more resilient.
The reality of the natural world is secure: man's attempts to fit nature into an ordered, subjective
structure of meaning can have no effect on a world “entirely at rest.”
The security of the natural world in this passage contrasts with the transitoriness of
meaning that Lily and William Bankes experience. The image of the sailboat letting fall its sails
indicates a completion of an action; the phrase “swift cutting race” suggests the briefness and the
inevitable end of all purpose and intention-- as a race only exists by its very ending, and only in
being won, and thus in being exhausted of significance, comes to be completed, so any purpose
by definition exists to be fulfilled and, in being fulfilled, is at once emptied. In such a way this
passage addresses one of Nietzsche's main concerns in his discussion of the Apollonian and the
Dionysian, the concern with time and the temporality of existence. It is a realization of the
temporariness of human meaning and experience by Lily that reveals the permanent meaning of
nature and the world in itself.
The middle section of Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse, entitled “Time Passes” describes
the changes that occur to the Ramsay family's summer house as the house stands abandoned for
years after Mrs. Ramsay's death. The characters whose thoughts and actions populate the first
section of the novel, “The Window,” disappear for most of “Time Passes,” reflecting the general
concern of each section: whereas “The Window” explores how meaning is created by the human
subject, “Time Passes” examines how meaning both continues and fails to function in the
absence of a thinking, perceiving subject.
In spring the garden urns, casually filled with wind-blown plants, were
gay as ever. Violets came and daffodils. But the stillness and the brightness of the
day were as strange as the chaos and tumult of the night, with the trees standing

there, looking before them, looking up, yet beholding nothing, eyeless, and so
terrible. (To the Lighthouse, p. 203)
As in the previous passage, Woolf presents the objective world in great detail, naming the types
of flowers growing in the garden; the mentions of “spring” and “the brightness of day”
emphasize the gaiety that would be perceived by a human viewer. However, without a perceiver
to comprehend and categorize them, the qualities of “stillness” and “brightness” that would be
meaningful to the human mind remain “strange as the chaos and tumult of the night.” Woolf
represents the universe as a dichotomy between a natural, primordial chaos that exists beyond the
scope and time of human society and a meaningful but artificially constructed human reality; her
use of images of darkness and light to describe the chaotic natural world and the human world
respectively suggests the absolute importance of perception in the generation of human meaning.
Darkness, after all, cannot be seen and is, in fact, defined by the very way in which it resists sight
and thus prevents the generation of knowledge, while light allows for perception and thus opens
the way to the creation of meaning. Thus whatever is not perceived by a human subject remains
entirely chaotic, as the signs of the coming spring season in Woolf's passage that might under
other circumstances be perceived as gay and bright remains “strange.” The final image of the
passage, which describes the unthinking, unperceiving trees as “terrible,” performs a subjective
interpretation of the experience of chaotic reality. The narrator of this passage acknowledges the
reality of a natural chaos that exists entirely outside human knowledge and is unable to resist
making a subjective value judgment upon this reality, suggesting the impossibility of a true
comprehension of reality by human thought; the human subject will inevitably interfere in and
alter the perception of reality it renders.
Woolf's novel, then, can be understood as addressing Nietzsche's concepts of the

Apollonian and Dionysian worlds as discussed in the introduction to this paper. Both passages
from To the Lighthouse discussed above demonstrate the way in which Woolf draws meaning out
of the very obliteration of objects and perceptions: Lily's perceptions and emotions are transient
and the human perceptions of the house and its garden are completely eliminated, but the passing
of these temporary human meanings is necessary in order to reveal a glimpse of objective truth
that they cover, namely, the reality of chaos and darkness, a reality that resists human
understanding: the Dionysian ocean of simultaneous destruction and creation, in which meaning
only exists without shape or form. The characters in To the Lighthouse consistently experience
what Nietzsche might describe as the Apollonian anxiety of attempting to providing structure and
meaning to a chaotic world-- in a sense, this very struggle, that of the individual working to
contain the immensity of the universe within his or her limited subjective experience, can be
understood as the primary conflict of the novel.
Early in “The Window” Mrs. Ramsay experiences the power of the chaos of the ocean:
“this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the other sounds suddenly thundered
hollow in her ears and made her look up with an impulse of terror.” In this moment she
recognizes a reality underneath that which she normally experiences, that of the Dionysian
chaos, but it is a reality that seems to be “hollow” or without meaning. This recognition of the
hollowness of objective truth poses a threat to the familiar concepts of human meaning (as,
earlier in the passage, Mrs. Ramsay imagines the waves causing “the destruction of the island
and its engulfment in the sea”) and thus generates a negative sensation of fear.
It seems that Woolf fully recognizes Nietzsche's categories of Dionysian and Apollonian,
recognizes, in other words, the chaotic nature of the universe upon which human beings impose,
through thought and language, the artificial structures of their societies and personal

perspectives. However, Woolf engages with these categories in a different manner and with a
different attitude than Nietzsche. Nietzsche expresses through his writing a desire to embrace
“the world as it is, without subtraction, exception, or selection” (The Will to Power, 1041) and a
view of human consciousness as mere illusion caused by the appearance of causality; he writes
of “the absurd overestimation of consciousness, the transformation of it into a unity, an entity:
'spirit,' 'soul,' something that feels, thinks, wills” (The Will to Power, 529). To Nietzsche, any
assertion of the Apollonian human perspective must necessarily perform violence against the
Dionysian truth. Woolf, in contrast, views the “triumph of Apollo,” the activity of human
consciousness and creativity in a chaotic world, as something to be celebrated. Each of the three
sections of To the Lighthouse explores the challenges faced by human characters as they attempt
to assert their individual wills and structured perspectives upon a fluid, chaotic world. In “The
Window,” the dinner party that occurs near the end of the book works as a figuration of the great
conflict between structured, Apollonian human unity and the chaos of the world; “they were all
conscious of making a party together in a hollow, on an island; had their common cause against
that fluidity out there” (To the Lighthouse, p. 147). It is upon the success of this dinner party that
the characters' senses of happiness and fulfillment depends. Indeed the entire novel ends with
Lily's victorious assertion of structure upon the natural world as she completes her work of art :
“with a sudden intensity, as if she saw it clear for a second, she drew a line there, in the centre”
(To the Lighthouse, p. 310). The way in which Woolf aligns the human capacity to achieve
personal fulfillment with the expansion and maintenance of human structures of meaning upon a
chaotic world suggests that, in contrast with Nietzsche's perspective, it is in the very imposition
of human subjectivity that meaning can be created. Whereas Nietzsche interprets human thought
as a process that ignores and thus eliminates the uniqueness of each transcient moment and of the

boundless reality occupying that moment, Woolf understands the process of generating
Apollonian meaning as being more valuable than the recognition the reality of the unstructured
world. Ultimately, the disagreement between Nietzsche and Woolf can be understood as being
based in a difference of priority: whereas Woolf's argument uses the tendencies of human nature
as a measure of value-- essentially arguing that the value of the objective world comes from its
ability to serve human subjectivity-- Nietzsche prioritizes an understanding and acceptance of
the inherent chaos of the universe. Woolf understands the imposition of meanings upon the world
as a testament to the power, courage, and value of the human subject-- she understands human
meaning to be arbitrary and artificial, but recognizes the expression of energy in the process of
creating meaning as being itself a sort of absolute meaning-- while Nietzsche takes the
artificiality of human meaning to be proof of its insignificance.
Proust addresses the relationship between perception and reality in his novel Swann's
Way. In particular Proust explores the nature of the process by which individuals create
meaningful experience. The following passage, in which the narrator Marcel describes his sexual
experiences as a youth, illustrates some of Proust's ideas about uniqueness and value:
I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has
not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in
whose company one has tasted it, when one has not yet reduced it to a general
idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the interchangeable
instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. (Swann's Way, pp. 221-222)
Proust describes in this passage how objects and the qualities they possess come to be removed
from one another. The narrator identifies two very different ways he has appreciated the sexual
pleasure that women have provided for him: as a youth he understood pleasure as belonging

individually and uniquely to each of the women with whom he experienced it, while as an adult,
in contrast, he experiences the different moments pleasure he experiences with each woman as
being the same pleasure. In fact, the adult narrator is able to recognize only the uniformity of all
pleasure; the women have lost their individual values and have become mere “interchangeable
instruments” subordinate to the pleasure itself. Proust identifies in this passage the same process
Nietzsche associates with the violence of Apollonianism: the recognition an object for its form--
the recognition of which requires comparison to other objects-- and for the attributes it shares
with other objects instead of for its uniqueness and for the value of its being in and of itself. In
other words, the value of a woman can be determined either by her individuality, in a Dionysian
process in which case the value is located objectively in the woman herself and in the specific
pleasure she alone can provide or, alternatively, by the extent to which she conforms to
subjective expectation. This latter sort of value, the Apollonian value, locates the value of an
object in the subject that perceives it, in a sense obliterating any inherent value contained within
the object itself. In a sense, it is this process of creating Apollonian value, a value that prioritizes
the perception of the human subject over the reality of the world, that Woolf is interested in
exploring and, arguably, promoting in To the Lighthouse. In contrast, Proust in Swann's Way
attempts to locate the meaningfulness of existence in beauty and complexity of the Dionysian
world
In Swann's Way Proust figures the Dionysian appreciation of life as it is as a celebration,
through emotional and sensory attentiveness and through description, of nature and of objects; as
the above passage illustrates, this Dionysian mode is associated closely for Proust with
childhood, while Apollonian categorization is associated with the adult world. In fact, Proust
views the adult world, particularly the world of society, as being formed entirely of subjective

categorizations:
In the end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, they
follow so exatcly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in the sound of
his voice as if it were no more than a transparent envelope, that each time we see
the face or hear the voice it is these notions which we recognize and to which we
listen. (Swann's Way, pp. 23-24)
In this remarkable passage Proust demonstrates the violence of subjective perception. As Proust
understands it, this violence works through replacement; over time, human beings come to
replace the actual object with which they interact with their mental concept of that object. In the
passage above, the actual material presence of the person under consideration, rendered in
phrases like “the curve of his cheeks,” “the line of his nose,” comes to be replaced by mere
“notions,” until it is only those subjective notions, and not at all the actual individual to whom
those notions seem to refer, with which the narrator interacts. The subjective mind, in other
words, is continually erasing actual objects and replacing them with artificial notions. To Proust,
the adult conception of reality is not founded in any sort of objective reality at all, but rather in
each person's individually constructed notions of reality.
Importantly, in Swann's Way this replacement of an objective Dionysian reality with the
Apollonian notion is a process that occurs over time, concurrent with and related to the process
of growing up from a child into an adult; based on this logic Proust locates in the experience of
his childhood a sort of objectivity-- he seems to measure the value of his narrator's experiences
largely by his sense of their authenticity to the objects that participate in them, the extent to
which they interact with and comprehend the unique, true objects themselves and not mere
perceptions of those objects. Of course, it is impossible for Proust to escape subjective

perception. In fact, he often measures the value of an object is by considering the amount of
subjective memories and feelings that the object yields; the evocation of these memories and
feelings, however, are distinctly treated not as a manipulation of the object by the subject's fitting
it into a specific function but rather as a way in which the object comes to exert its power over
the perceiving subject. In other words, in Proust, the relationship between the human perceiver
and the thing being perceived is not one of domination by the subject of a submissive object; it is
rather a cooperative process in which the mutual energy of the perceiver and the object come
together to produce a complex and continually changing set of perceptions, memories, thoughts,
and feelings
The following description of a stained-glass window demonstrates the complexity of the
relationship between the human perceiver and object he perceives:
There was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred
little rectangular panes, of blue principally, like an enormous pack of cards of the
kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a ray of sunlight had
gleamed through it or because my own shifting glance had sent shooting across
the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns, a rare and
flickering fire-- the next instant it had taken on the shimmering brilliance of a
peacock's tail, then quivered and rippled in a flaming and fantastic shower that
streamed from the groin of the dark and stony vault down the moist walls, as
though it were along the bed of some grotto glowing with sinuous stalactites that I
was following my parents. (Swann's Way, pp. 81-82)
There is a remarkable fluidity of power in this passage. It remains unclear to Marcel, for
example, whether the change he notices in the brightness of the window is due to the natural

energy of the sun-- “because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it”-- or is an effect of his
“own shifting glance.” In other words, the powers of objectivity, represented here by the
sunlight, and of Marcel's subjectivity are confused. Marcel never determines the cause of the
change and seems, in fact, quite unconcerned with doing so; he is much more interested in the
effect itself. Proust describes in exquisite detail Marcel's perception of the colorful window; by
comparing the window to a “peacock's tail”-- a living animal-- and using verbs such as
“quivered” and “streamed” that generate a sense of motion and energy, Proust emphasizes quite
dramatically the vitality the window seems to possess. To young Marcel the window has a
tremendous effect and causes him even to reinterpret his surroundings. In a reversal of the
traditional Apollonian subject/object relationship, in which it is the subject that acts upon the
object, fitting the object into a predetermined structure of meanings and eliminating the object's
uniqueness, in this moment in Swann's Way it is the very object with which Marcel interacts-- the
stained-glass window-- that subordinates him, using its power to remove him from the church
and placing him into a “grotto glowing with sinuous stalactites.” It is almost as if the passage
under consideration is a description of the combination of Marcel's perception of the window and
the window's perception of Marcel.
Proust finds value in the processuality of perception, in the unexpected way that out of
the brief subjective perception of a seemingly simple object can spring an infinity of experiences
and emotions; this process is explored in the narrative structure of Swann's Way, in which
sensory perceptions, emotional recollections, character portraits, and stories are continuously
interwoven. In other words, to Proust meaning is generated not out a sense of direction towards a
goal of structure and knowledge but rather out of an understanding of the very transcience of
experience and knowledge-- objects are understood as being connected not by similarity of

quality or form (a vertical, metaphorical similarity that effectively preserves a broad category or
attribute over time), but by similarity of situation or context (a horizontal, metonymic similarity
of being connected by place and action, of simply being alive and present, or, in Nietzsche's
terms, of possessing “the eternal will to procreation, to fruitfulness, to recurrence; the feeling of
the necessary unity of creation and destruction”). This is in contrast with the way meaning is
defined in Woolf's To the Lighthouse, in which, as discussed above, value is generated through
the effort of the human subject to contain the object within structures of intellectual and social
thought, an effort which has the effect of resisting the destructive effects of time.
Even the titles of the two novels, Swann's Way and To the Lighthouse, when we examine
the significance of the image to which each title refers in the broader context of each novel,
reflect the great philosophical differences between them. The title To the Lighthouse references a
trip to the island lighthouse near the Ramsay's house, the feasibility of which is questioned
throughout “The Window,” that is made only near the very end of “The Lighthouse,” the final
section of the novel. The title Swann's Way refers to a path, one of two, along which the narrator
takes frequent walks with his family. Both titles refer to journeys-- both novels are, after all,
about the “journey” of the human subject attempting to discover the meaning of experience-- but
the two journeys are remarkably different. Woolf's journey is unidirectional, a movement from
one place to another, without return and with a specific goal in mind; perhaps most significantly,
it is a journey that exists for most of the novel entirely in the future. This suggests the inherent
unachievability of Woolf's Apollonian generation of meaning-- its very existent depends on the
conflict between human reason and natural chaos. Proust, in contrast, embraces natural chaos and
the transcience of subjective thought. Proust's journey is circular; the starting point and the
ending point are the same-- Marcel's home at Combray. In other words, it is a journey without a

goal (or a journey with a goal that is being constantly achieved), a journey for the pure sake of
enjoyment, the significance of which is located not in a specific future destination to be reached
but rather in the continually recurring present moment of the journey and in the details and
pleasures to be found inhabiting that moment:
...a sound of echoless footsteps on a gravel path, a bubble formed against
the side of a water-plant by the current of the stream and instantaneously
bursting-- all these my exaltation of mind has borne along with it and kept alive
through the succession of the years, while all around them the paths have
vanished and those who trod them, and even the memory of those who trod them,
are dead. (Swann's Way, p.259)
Thus it is apparent that Proust in Swann's Way and Woolf in To the Lighthouse, though they are
both concerned with meaning and the relationship of the human subject to the world, explore the
problems in markedly different ways.

Essay 2 – Topic 4
9 November 2004
Comparing Interpretations
In the study of ancient literature, it is essential to read the ancient text.
This becomes very difficult when not everyone who may want to read a work of
Classical Greek drama is able to read ancient Greek. Therefore, readers must
depend on a translator to deliver an accurate interpretation of the work. Due to
this reader-translator relationship, it brings to question the magnitude of this
dependence. In the name of artistry or personal taste, one translation can be
drastically different from another. Which translation a reader chooses could
utterly alter his or her impression of the original author and possibly all ancient
texts. A comparison of David Slavitt and Herbert Smyth’s translations of
Aeschylus’ The Persians shows how disparate interpretations of the same piece
can be.
To evaluate the difference between translations, noting the difference
between translators may be beneficial. Herbert Smyth was a Harvard professor
of Classics who published his translation in 1926.1 David Slavitt is a novelist and
a journalist for Newsweek who published his translation in 1999.2 An easily
identifiable difference between the two versions is use of a more modern syntax
by Slavitt. Additionally, Slavitt, who even claims to be presumptuous in his
introduction, expresses and refers to many modern themes. A lot of “history”
occurred between 1926 and 1999. Slavitt not only lets this history influence his
translation of a play written over 2000 years before any of it happened, he
includes portions of modern history in his version. It is doubtful that Aeschylus
knew anything about dealings in Rawanda such that one of the chorus elders
could refer to the conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi (Slavitt, 108). Nor, would it
seem likely for the actual ancient text to contain any reference to New York,

Erickson 2
California, Japanese peoples, or the political tensions in a Europe that will not
exist for two millennia (40). Possibly, these references were added to the play
for the sake of helping a modern audience relate to the text, but this shows how a
translator’s goals might affect the interpretation of a work of ancient literature.
Another discrepancy between the two translations relates to the length of
each. As mentioned before, without the ability to read the actual ancient text, a
reader also lacks the ability to check whether a part of the translation is
congruent with the original. Smyth seems to have published a translation of the
entire play, whereas comparison shows Slavitt has summarized many of the
conversations, left out entire discussions, and added convenient remarks for the
purpose of humor. For example, Atossa, the Queen Mother of Persia has many
lines in Smyth’s translation. Before the tidings of bad news is brought by the
herald, she asks the chorus of elders about the location of Athens and a
discussion ensues concerning the size of the Athenian army and the manner in
which Greeks fight (Smyth, 230). This conversation is found nowhere in the
translation by Slavitt. Moreover, Slavitt has added a Prologue to his version of
the play. This narrator-of-sorts shares no part in the translation by Smyth, but
Slavitt’s Prologue appears in hundreds of lines as a mockery of the Aeshcylean
text. Speaking directly to the audience, his part includes such witty remarks as
offering to replay a rather dramatic discourse of the Persian’s defeat (Slavitt,
431), and, “He could do the whole Susa phone book…” when the messenger
reports names of some of the fallen Persian warriors (309). Even with the
addition of this prologue, Slavitt’s translation is over one hundred lines shorter
than Smyth’s. It is possible that this brevity would be helpful in some situations,
but it is also possible that this translation lacks many important aspects
Aeschylus meant to convey to his audience. If the translator conveniently
chooses not to include certain portions of the work, an entirely different play is
set before the reader.
In order to make a translation flow with the same artistic style as the
original, a translator takes certain liberties with the translation, such as word
choice and use of idioms. As Slavitt’s translation has a more modern syntax, it

Erickson 3
also uses more idioms found in the modern American English language. For
example, Darius shouting, “Spit it out!” at Atossa (Slavitt, 637). Then, later in the
play, Slavitt’s translation takes a turn toward vulgar, when the chorus of elders
become more foul-mouthed than might be expected from any type of public
writing (914-961). Readers who are not familiar with Aeschylus from other
translators may believe this is typical of ancient dramas, which it is obviously not
as Smyth’s version shows with its lack of obscenities.
An important difference between the two versions of Aeschylus’ The
Persians, concerns the portrayal of Greeks and Persians within the play.
Smyth’s translation refers to Greeks directly very few times, but as his translation
is more likely to reflect the actual words of Aeschylus, it would be much safer to
assume Aeschylus refers to specific Greeks only a few times during the play. By
contrast, Slavitt refers to Greeks more frequently throughout the text, but whether
he is referring to modern Greeks, ancient Greeks, or even makes the distinction
himself at all, is rather confusing. For example, Greeks are referred to as olive
oil salesmen, pizza parlor owners, as men who wear skirts, and women with
excessive facial hair (Slavitt, 115). This is a Persian character insulting the
Greeks, but obviously, Aeschylus did not put those words into the chorister’s
mouth. Typically, a reference to Greeks in Smyth’s translation would involve
Persians saying directly, “Hateful, indeed, is Athens to her foes,” (Smyth, 286) or
Athens “…is now the cause of our lament.” (890) Slavitt, however, refers to an
Athenian sitting in the audience gloating at the pain of the Persians (Slavitt, 20).
Slavitt’s Prologue also mentions “Athens’ appetite for Persian abasement” (373)
and that Athens chooses how the history shall be told as the victor of the war
(390). These references, being entirely different in nature, cause Slavitt’s play to
seem rather derisive while Smyth’s version seems targeted more at an Athenian
audience than the rest of Greece, though still directly focused on a Persian
tragedy from a Persian’s point-of-view. Whichever tone Aeschylus wanted to
convey to his audience, or whether it was both, is difficult to evaluate by reading
one version without the other.

Erickson 4
As Aeschylus was an Athenian playwright, his play would have been
performed for a primarily Greek, primarily Athenian audience. The portrayal of
Persians in his work directly reflects either what he thought of Persians or what
his audience thought of Persians. In Smyth’s interpretation, the central theme of
Persian involvement in the play is to express their woe at a terrible and
unexpected defeat. The characters lament at the loss of Persian royal power
(Smyth, 584) and the loss of “all that once was Persia” to the bloody waters of
the Hellenes (591). The sorrows grow throughout the play, ending with Xerxes
almost whining at how wretched he has made Persia to be. In Xerxes’ later
remarks, he wails back and forth with the chorus of elders, telling them how badly
he feels such that they should feel bad for him too (Smyth, 1040-end). Slavitt
portrays the Persians as boasting popinjays for an Athenian audience (a group
with personal foresight on the subject) and as a joke for his contemporary
audience. For example, the choristers act like immature teenagers, chanting to
the audience and using foul language (Slavitt, 124), while in Smyth’s version they
are the chorus of elders left in charge of Persia during Xerxes expedition (Smyth,
1). Moreover, the Prologue in Slavitt’s version practically spells it out to the
reader that Greeks watch the play only for the pleasure of seeing Persians
crushed with despair (Slavitt, 20-73). He does not leave this for the reader’s
interpretation, but states it quite plainly such that no question of his intent
remains. Smyth does not make any boldly noticeable moves to sway a reader’s
interpretations.
The Smyth translation differs from the Slavitt translation again in the
portrayal of Darius. To the Persians, he was a God for not destroying Persia with
senseless war (Smyth, 655) and was “envied of all” for his prosperous and happy
life (713). If all envied him, then Darius was subject to the envy of Greeks as well
as Persians. This would certainly be showing Darius a lot of respect for his
abilities and accomplishments in life. Alternately, Slavitt portrays him as a
“master of masters” (Slavitt, 622) worthy of the “reverence and honor due the
greatest of nether gods.” (605). The first words out of him mouth, however,
include a comparison of his wife to fecal matter and insults to the men he

Erickson 5
deemed friends (626). Unless such “artistic” use of language signifies to a
modern audience that Darius should be highly honored, Slavitt does not
emphasize the same interpretation as Smyth of the Greek’s respect for Darius.
In the conversation with Atossa on how this calamity may have occurred,
Darius decides Xerxes was not thinking clearly in his reckless youthfulness
(Smyth, 725-745). He also proposes the possibility that the temptation of the
wealth he amassed during his reign had spoiled the boy (750), but Atossa
assures him evil council caused his ambitions in Greece (755). From a father’s
point of view, Darius is greatly concerned for his son, showing that Persians have
families and feelings too. Smyth interpreted Aeschylus to have wanted the
Persians to appear as people to which his audience could relate. In addition,
mentioning Xerxes’ not thinking clearly (725), Smyth’s version adds a little
humor, because it is easy to picture the Greeks thinking this after defeating the
Persians a second time. Again, Darius’ admonition against ever invading the
land of the Hellenes (790) shows Athenian wishful thinking, adding to the
humorous effect. Slavitt, however, portrays Darius insulting Xerxes’ greed and
accuses him of insanity (Slavitt, 655), showing a more authoritative and uncaring
side of his fatherhood. Slavitt’s Darius then begins a tirade against the audience
and Prologue, as though a play is not taking place at all (680-711).
Darius' warning about dishonoring the Gods corresponds in both
translations. Smyth’s Darius tells the elders and Atossa that Xerxes must have
thought he could outsmart Poseidon and win victory without gaining favor of the
Gods (Smyth, 750). Then, the Persian force sealed its fate by destroying
religious icons in the Greek lands through which it marched, angering the Gods
further (810). Darius even goes so far as to issue a warning that presumptuous
pride only ends in calamity (820). Slavitt’s translation says much the same,
though in his own style. The Darius in Slavitt’s version tells the chorus of elders
the Persian’s folly in disrespecting the “measure and manners and order” of
Greece (Slavitt, 722). Then, however, Darius foretells the future, mentioning
modern cities and modern struggles in the world and ties the warnings into these
references (728). While a reader may interpret both translations similarly,

Erickson 6
Smyth’s version requires a reader to piece Darius’ dialogue and the rest of the
play together to understand Aeschylus’ warning. Slavitt directly states, “The
overweening pride of Xerxes is not a particularly Persian failing,” (690) to make
sure no one misses the warning or its application to the modern world. By doing
this, Slavitt denies the reader a chance to make the discovery that Aeschylus
wanted his audience not to get a big head because the war could just as easily
have ended the other way around.
The differences between Smyth’s translation and Slavitt’s rendition of
Aeschylus’ play make a reader question the validity of all published translations.
Opinions on the subject vary, but deciding on which version a reader should rely
for an accurate source is difficult to assess, because each causes the reader to
consider different aspects of the story. The sympathy shown in Smyth’s
translation signifies the sympathy an Athenian would feel for a defeated country,
a humane sympathy for those labeled not as enemy but as human being.
Additionally, victory is all the sweeter when the defeated foe was an equal or a
better opponent. The Athenians probably felt relieved to be done with a war, but
knew the Gods had blessed them to help the Greek navy and army win against
what would seem insurmountable odds. Slavitt insists this is not human nature to
feel sorrow so quickly after such a brutal war, thus Aeschylus could not have
meant to show sympathy towards the Persians at all. Instead, Aeschylus must
have meant to poke fun at the enemy in order to please the audience through
“schadenfreude.” (Slavitt, 582) This interpretation reflects the evidence of
extreme competitive spirit in Grecian culture. It is interesting to hear both points
of view, but the method which Slavitt employs to tell the audience his perspective
is disrespectful not only to Aeschylus, but to his audience as well. In the name of
humor, it is acceptable if not advisable to publish a piece of this content, but to
publish the work under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Press, as
an original Greek drama may be too presumptuous.
These two translations of Aeschylus’ The Persians show the magnitude of
inconsistency writers convey with their interpretation of a work. Not only are
characters portrayed differently, but critical elements of the plot also disagree.

Erickson 7
Considering this, it may be necessary for a reader to compare two or more
translations of a text in order to grasp at least in some way what the original
author intended. Unfortunately, for those reading for enjoyment, this seems
superfluous. In allowing a translator’s freedom of creativity, the audience’s
interpretation is manipulated with an extreme effect being the loss of the original
author’s purpose and style. Perhaps the most ideal solution, however impractical
it may seem, is for everyone to learn ancient Greek in order to formulate his or
her own opinion of the author’s intent. Otherwise, a reader can expect no more
than a second-hand interpretation of the author’s words and possibly a skewed
image of his purpose."

Reading questions for Christian, Maps of Time, Chapter 14
From the perspective of “big history,” what are some of the most important events of the 20th
century? (440)
How is the Modern Revolution a “phenomenological one,” i.e. one in which the frameworks of
existence –space and time—have changed? Recall that the subtitle of Schivelbusch’s book The
Railway Journey is “the industrialization of time and space in the 19th century,” and recall also
the description in the Communist Manifesto that “all that is solid melts into air….” Does this
suggest that time and space began to be compressed/expanded before the 20th century?
According to Christian, what is distinctive about the way they have changed in the 20th century?
(440-42)
How has world population grown in the 20th century? (442-43 including table on 443)
How has world production grown in the 20th century? (444-46) What does the table on p. 445 tell
you about the organization of production in the 20th century?
What are some of the largest and most obvious “waves of innovation” in the 20th century? What
assumptions are made when the role of technology in history is described in this way? (442-44)
Compare capitalist cycles of over-abundance with Malthusian cycles of scarcity. Have the
former displaced the latter or do they coexist, perhaps in new combinations? How do they result
in new ways of thinking about history itself (to paraphrase Hobsbawm, p. 442)? How do they
result in new roles for governments? For non-governmental corporations? (refer back to table on
p. 445) How is “tribute” exacted in the age of consumer capitalism?
What are some of the ethical and behavioral changes that have emerged in an age of consumer
capitalism? (447-48)
According to Christian, what is the historical relationship between equality and productivity in
modern capitalist societies? Do you find his analysis convincing? What evidence does he provide
of inequities within and among nations? What is the direction of change in equity of distribution?
Can you imagine a role for “technology in history” that alters the current trend towards greater
inequity? If so, what would that role be? (448-51, including tables on p. 450 and 452)
The “creative destruction” of capitalism (Schumpeter’s expression) continues to render extinct
long-established ways of life. What are some of them? What others would you add from your
own experience of knowledge? (451-54)
How has capitalism also rendered extinct, or nearly so, traditionally organized tributary empires?
What are some examples? How does Christian explain his paradoxical listing of Communist
empires under this heading? Do you find his analysis persuasive? Can you think of other parts of
the world where governments are not primarily organized around capitalist methods and values?
(454-57)

How do the war-related conflicts of the 20th century compare with such conflicts in earlier
centuries? Consider how this analysis connects with what we learned about the American Civil
War as an “industrial war.” What are Christian’s predictions regarding the future of warfare?
(457-59)
How does Christian measure and summarize changes in the relationship between humanity and
our home planet in the 20th century? What are some of the obvious critical limits that need to be
dealt with in the 21st century? How do you find yourself reacting to this summary of serious
problems? What is the role of “technology” in addressing them? What other forms of creativity
are needed? (459-63)

"Reading questions on Christian, Chapter 9
“From Power over Nature to Power over People: Cities, States, and `Civilizations.”
Why do you think Christian puts “civilizations” in quotes in the chapter title? (see p. 248)
You might start at the end, where Christian summarizes the relevance of the history of early
agricultural states to the history of technologies. Keep in mind these big themes as you read:
technological momentum, larger settlements, increasing productivity, coercive modes of power
as power over nature becomes power over people (281-282).
What do you think of his initial analogy between the physical and the social universe, i.e. how
the force of gravity works in both settings? (245)
What are the general dates of the community-based Paleolithic era and the appearance of the first
states in the Middle East, northern India and China, and Mesoamerica?
Look at the maps on pp. 246-7: what modern states occupy these territories?
Christian refers to a social scientist, Marvin Harris, to suggest that a major change in the human
condition is not necessarily “progress” (248). You will recall Christian’s earlier reference to
Marshall Sahlin’s “stone age economics” (185-87). Is he making a similar point? If so, what is
it? If not, what are the differences?
(Harris’s work is mentioned again on p. 272. Does this example support the thesis of Harris as
described on p. 248?)
The chart on p. 249 and figure 9.1 (p. 250) are helpful in making distinctions among terms such
as “family” and different types of extended groups, many still kinship-based (such as “clan” or
“tribe”). Make sure you review them to get a sense of the different types of groups that form
basic social organizations in the absence of state structures. Do you think the groups still persist
even in state-based political settings?
Make sure you understand Christian’s ecological explanation of the emergence of state power,
i.e. human society becomes the niche in which elites forage for resources. Again he is making
analogies between human society and the nonhuman world, in transitions to greater social
complexity. Are you persuaded that these analogies are valid and useful? (249-252)
Why is the transition to agriculture so important in human history? (252-53) What are some of
the critical changes after the introduction of domestication that made it significantly more
productive? What are some new sources of energy that were tapped by these changes? (253-258)
Once again “intensification” and “extensification” are contrasted as two ways that humans
extend their powers over the rest of the world. Make sure you understand the distinction and can
give examples of each process (256, 259)
What are some new materials that began to be worked in agrarian regions? (258-59)
What are the population trends in early agrarian regions? (259)

Explain the causal connections (including feedback loops) of population growth, agricultural
surpluses, and social inequalities. Do these inequalities appear to be inevitable? Is there
apparently some trade-off between overall wealth and overall equality in human societies? Do
these inequalities have a strong gender component? What is patriarchy? (259-264)
One hypothesis, as explained by Christian, is that consent-based power inevitably/necessarily
mutates into coercive power. Is this persuasive? Are there other explanations that seem
plausible? What forms of leadership seem most common in early agriculture-based societies?
(264-67)
Christian defines cities as “wholly humanized environments.” (267) So are cities technologies?
Do they have a major role as “technologies in history”? If so, what kind of role (see figure 9.3
for a hint)?
How do the details of geographical positioning and climate affect the development of cities?
How does their presence in turn “warp” the surrounding geography? (268-71)
How do cities affect the distribution of social power? (271-72)
What do you think of Tilly’s definition of states on p. 273?
What are some of the inherent weaknesses of these early states? How is violence different from
power? (273-74)
Look at the Standard Professions List as described on p. 274. How does it compare with your
sense of standard professions in today’s world?
On p. 275 Christian describes the transition from a kinship-based society to a class-based society.
Is this the end of prehistory? When does prehistory end?
When, why, and how was writing invented? (275-278)
All through this chapter Christian has mentioned the emergence of organized warfare. Connect
these dots to get an idea of when and how armies arose as a standard part of human societies.
What is their role in conflict with other groups? What is their role within the state? (248)
Here Christian calls upon another social scientist, Eric Wolf, to make a distinction between kin-
ordered and tribute-taking societies. Is the latter the same as a class-divided society? How is the
transition from the first to the second connected with technological changes? (278-280, with
emphasis on Table 9.3; also p. 282)
How does the model of transition from community-based to state-based agricultural societies fit
the sequence of events in Mesoamerica? (280-281)
Christian returns again to an analogy between human societies and nonhuman life (namely social
insects), to explain why the “demographic dynamism” associated with agriculture leads
inevitably to the social results described in this chapter. Do you find this analogy convincing? Do
you find his assertion of historical inevitability—technological determinism, if you will—
convincing? (281)

Reread the summary to make sure you understand this long and complicated argument about the
reasons for the emergence of cities, states, and civilizations in history.
Look over the bibliography to get a sense of some of the major works and themes in early
agrarian-based history.
Does Christian’s account remind you of anything else you have read in history? As you get
deeper into the book, what do you think of it? How might you write a review of it to post on, for
example, Amazon.com?

Final Paper
Ancient Greece
The Center of the Greek World: The Myth and Reality of Delphi
The legend goes that Zeus took two eagles and released them at different
ends of the world, one in the east and one in the west. When they met again, it
was in Delphi, which was thus declared the center of the world. As in many
mythical stories, which attempt to explain a given phenomena through acts of the
gods, there was surely some reason behind this story. In other words, in some
way the Greeks must have seen Delphi as the center of the world. Looking back
through history, ways in which this mythical claim was true can be examined. To
begin, Delphi was certainly a great and important religious center. People from
all over Greece came to visit the oracle, and the temple of Apollo was built
through contributions from city-states throughout Greece. The Pythian Games in
Delphi, held every four years, was an event which brought together all of Greece.
Many Greek city-states also set up treasuries in Delphi which represented a
more peaceful method of competition than the wars were parallel. Much Greek
history passed through and was influenced by Delphi, and Delphi certainly
represents and symbolizes the panhellenism of Greece. In Delphi, the
independent nature of each individual city-state was represented through the
individual treasuries. At the same time, these treasuries were all located in the
same sacred ground and all the city-states collectively supported the temple and
Delphi’s public buildings. Delphi’s independence as a panhellenic site was also
protected by all Greek city-states. Delphi sits at the center of Greek religion,

politics, and history, and is certainly worthy of the claim that it was the center of
the Greek world.
Other myths point to Delphi as the center of Greece as well as the story of
the two eagles. One myth tells that Apollo came down from Mt. Olympus to
destroy Python, the serpent who guarded the original shrine to the earth-mother
Gaia. As Homer told the story, ""he killed the fearsome dragon Python, piercing it
with his darts” (http://www.pantheon.org/articles/d/delphi.html, 12/08/2004).
Then, after killing Python, Apollo left for a time to make amends for this deed.
Upon his return, Apollo set up his temple, and at the place where the serpent
was killed, an omphalos stone was set in the ground. The omphalos stone
represented the “center of the earth,” or “navel of the world.” Again here is a
reference to Delphi as the center of the earth.
There is also a legend that says Apollo jumped aboard a Cretan ship in
the form of a dolphin and brought the sailors to Delphi. Upon arrival, he turned
into a handsome young man and asked the sailors to stay and be priests in his
temple. This myth explains how the location came to be called Delphi, because
the Greek word for dolphin was delphis. The word delphis was also Greek for
womb, (connected to dolphins, since they were mammals, not fish, and thus had
wombs) which may also have been connected to the idea that Delphi was the
center of the world. (http://iam.classics.unc.edu/loci/del/16_hist.html,
12/08/2002). Whatever the myth, it is clear that Delphi was regarded as a central
city to the whole of the Greek society throughout much of its history.
Truly, the Delphic oracle played a central role through many centuries of
Greek history. It is hard to pick up a history book on ancient Greece without
reading about a decision which was made based on consultation of the Delphic
oracle. In the first book of The Peloponnesian War, for example, Thucydides
tells a story about the Epidamnians. In the story, the Epidamnians were hard
pressed at war, and when the Corcyraeans refused to help them, they “were in a

quandary about what to do next. So they sent to Delphi and inquired of the god”
(Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 1.25). The oracle gave an answer, and
they then proceeded to follow its advice. Such inquiry of the oracle in political
matters was common to city-states from all over Greece and was found in much
of Greek history. In Plutarch’s Lycurgus, one story goes that Lycurgus had his
people swear an oath that they would abide by his laws until he returned from
Delphi. Traveling to Delphi, he “sacrificed to the god, and then asked whether
the laws he had made were in fact good enough to guarantee the material and
moral welfare of the state. The god replied that the legislative measures that he
had taken were good, and that by keeping to Lycurgus’ constitution the state
would continue to be held in highest honor” (Plutarch, Lycurgus 29). In order to
keep his people abiding by his laws, he killed himself and thus never returned to
Sparta to free his people from their oath. The oracle’s response, history revealed
as quite accurate, as the Spartans were the most powerful Greek city-state for a
long time afterwards.
The accuracy of the oracle in the case above was not an anomaly. Often,
in fact, the Delphic oracle (also called the Pythian oracle) was quite accurate.
This only increased Delphi’s prominence, leading it towards becoming “the center
of the world.” In Herodotus’ account of Croesus, the idea that the Delphic oracle
was truly the best oracle, and therefore the only one worth consulting is laid out
clearly. Croesus sends men to many different oracles and instructs them to go to
the respective oracle at a specific time and ask what Croesus was doing at that
very moment. According to the story, only the Delphic oracle gave an answer
which was correct, and thus Croesus declared “that the oracle at Delphi was the
only genuine one in the world, because it had succeeded in finding out what he
had been doing” (Herodotus, The Histories 1.48). This reputation was supported
by many other cases, and kept people coming back for hundreds of years to
follow.

This is not to say that the Delphic oracle was always clear. According to
Heraclitus, a philosopher around 500 BC, the Pythia never gave a straight
answer. The oracle “neither conceals nor reveals the truth, but only hints at it”
(http://www.aroundparnassos.com/history/, 12/8/2004), Heraclitus said. Yet even
ambiguous answers or unclear answers could be interpreted after the fact as
being valid, and thus the fame of the Delphic oracle was not marred. The
oracle’s response to the Athenians that “…the wooden wall only shall not fall, but
help you and your children…” (Herod., The Histories 7.141) was not clear at all,
and the Athenians had many ways to interpret it. Themistocles interpreted it as
meaning they should put their effort towards their navy and their wooden ships
were what the oracle meant by wooden walls. When the Athenians were
victorious at sea, it was declared that the oracle was correct and that this had
indeed been the meaning. One could go on and on about how correct or valid
these oracular messages actually were. Yet, without going into a discussion
about the oracle’s methods or methods of fortune telling, let it simply be said that
the Greeks believed that these prophesies held some truth. The point is that due
to its success, people came from all over Greece. Thus, one can imagine that if
they were in Delphi in ancient times, they would run into people from all over
Greece and could learn quite a lot about the current affairs of the world. The
oracle was also consulted often for commercial ventures and colonization efforts,
as well as personal questions of all sorts, and so one might also imagine that a
whole history of Greece could be observed through Delphi – a history covering
political movements as well as economic and social structure. Viewed in this
way, Delphi really seems to be the center of the Greek world and much of Greek
history.
Yet not only did Delphi bear witness to a great deal of Greek history
through the Pythian oracle, it also had a great deal of power to change Greek
history. When the oracle was given, people listened and took it seriously. When

the Alcmaeonidae bribed the priestess to tell the Spartans that they must
overthrow the Athenian tyranny, the Spartans proceeded to do so against their
wishes. As Herodotus describes, “The Pisistratidae were good friends of theirs:
but no matter – the commands of God were more important to them than human
ties” (Herod., The Histories 5.63). The demands of Apollo thus carried a lot of
power. If Apollo told a city-state to do something, they most likely would comply.
In another case, Apollo orders Athens to return the Delians, and they
correspondingly do so. As Thucidydes describes, they “brought back the Delians
to Delos, moved by … the commands of the god at Delphi” (Thuc. The
Peloponnesian War, 5.32). There was a lot of power in the fact that Greeks
believed that the oracle was absolute. The idea that the oracle couldn’t be
wrong, and that its command must be followed was expressed even by
philosophers such as Socrates. Plato relates Socrates’ views in his Apology, in
which he has Socrates responding to the oracle’s claim that Socrates was the
wisest. “What then does he mean by declaring that I am the wisest,” Socrates
says. “He certainly cannot be lying, for that is not possible for him” (Plato,
Apology 21). Whether or not Socrates himself actually believed this, he was
certainly affirming the common view about the oracle in attempting to assert that
he was not an atheist. The oracle accordingly, had power over all of Greece, and
in this way was central to Greek history.
In many ways Delphi can be seen as a central symbol of panhellenic
Greek society. While most of Greece was composed of small independent city
states who were often enemies of one another, they were still held together by a
common language and common religious beliefs. While an Athenian would have
thought of himself as primarily an Athenian, and a Spartan as a Spartan, he
would probably have had some concept of being part of the larger Greek society
as well. The fact that there were terms like “medizing” and that there was a
common effort to expel the Persians show this panhellenism. Delphi, as well, is

an example of the Greeks caming together for a common cause. As one of the
four great panhellenic sanctuaries where festivals and athletic games took place
(the others were Nemea, Isthmia and Olympia), Delphi saw people pour into the
city every four years. The games brought contestants and spectators from all
over Greece and even brought foreigners. Success in the games gave the
athletes much prestige and honor, and they would have been met with respect
throughout all of Greece. The nature of the games was very sacred and
ritualistic, and control over the games gave a lot of power to Delphi.
Delphi was set apart from the other sanctuaries though, in that it also was
the place of the temple to Apollo and numerous treasuries. This was another
great attraction which brought together people from all over Greece. For
example, in 548 BC, and again in 373 BC, the temple to Apollo was destroyed,
the first case due to fire, the latter to an earthquake. In both cases though, the
temple was rebuilt through contributions from all over Greece, as well as Egypt
and Lydia in the first case (http://iam.classics.unc.edu/loci/del/16_hist.html). As
Herodotus describes, when “the Delphians went round from city to city asking for
contributions, Egypt was by no means least in giving assistance” (Herod., The
Histories 2.180). While the context of this passage was of a discussion of Egypt,
it is clear from this excerpt that the Delphians would expect contributions for their
sanctuary from all parts of Greece. Certainly massive amounts of wealth flowed
into the city, and through panhellenic contributions, Delphi was also able to build
numerous other public buildings. In the 5th century BC a stadium was built and
later, in the 4th century, a theater was built. There was also a public gymnasium,
a magnificent building called the Tholos, and no doubt many other buildings
(http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21110a/e211ja01.html, 12/08/2004).
Perhaps more significantly, city-states from all over Greece set up
treasuries in Delphi, erecting grand monumental buildings dedicated to the gods.
Thus in one central location, city-states representing all of panhellenic Greece

built together in relative peace. Enemies and allies alike shared the sacred
ground that these treasuries were built on, showing just how highly the respect
for Delphi was across all Greece. A great example of this is that after defeating
the Athenians in the Peloponnesian war, the Syracusans built a treasury in
Delphi right across from the treasury of the Athenians
(http://www.aroundparnassos.com/history/, 12/08/2004). Essentially, these
treasuries were buildings to house dedications. Through the dedications, many
historic events could be seen, marked down at Delphi through some offering or
another. A part of the plunder from many major battles was always set aside to
be sent to Delphi. One example of this from Herodotus tells how after the
Greeks had won some victory over the Persians, “they then turned to the division
of plunder, and sent to Delphi the ‘first fruits’ set apart for the purpose; from these
was made the statue, eighteen feet high, which had the beak of a ship in its
hand, and stands beside the gold statue of Alexander of Macedon” (Herod., The
Histories 8.121). Again, talking of a victory by Pausanias, Herodotus writes,
“when all the stuff had been collected, a tenth was set apart for the god at Delphi”
(Herod., The Histories 9.81). Dedications were a way to show off to the rest of
the world, to show just how victorious a battle was, or to show just how wealthy a
city-state was. Siphnos, for instance, was one of the richest states of Greece,
and built a magnificent temple to show off their wealth. Similarly, individuals with
enough success made dedications on their own. For example, Polyzalos, a
Syracusan, celebrated a victory at the Phythian Games of 474 with the
dedication of a bronze statue, now famously know as the ‘Charioteer’
(Hornblower, The Greek World p. 46). Another example comes from Herodotus,
who describes a man at one point as “Euelthon, who dedicated the remarkable
censer in the Corinthian treasure-house at Delphi” (Herod., The Histories 4.162).
The idea that the various dedications in Delphi marked a city-state’s success for
all the world to see adds to the understanding of why Greeks saw Delphi as the

“navel of the world.” These were definite signs, and when after a certain battle in
the 9th year of the Peloponnesian War, “both sides set up trophies and sent
spoils to Delphi” (Thud., The Peloponnesian War 4.134), it was unclear exactly
who was victorious.
The desire for Delphi to be accessible to all Greeks and for the treasure
there to be kept sacred was an important one. This is well illustrated in a peace
treaty between the Athenians and the Spartans during the Peloponnesian War.
Before the terms of the peace that affect one side or the other are even given,
two terms are set out to protect the access to and the treasure of Delphi. The
following passage from Thucydides gives the terms.
“An armistice was accordingly concluded by Sparta and her allies upon
the terms following:
• As to the temple and oracle of the Pythian Apollo, we are
agreed that whoever so wishes shall have access to it, without
fraud or fear, according to the usages of his forefathers. [2] The
Spartans and the allies present agree to this, and promise to
send heralds to the Boetians and Phocians, and to do their best
to persuade them to agree likewise.
• [3] As to the treasure of the god, we agree to exert ourselves to
detect all wrongdoers, truly and honestly following the customs
of our forefathers, we and you and all others willing to do so, all
following the customs of our forefathers. [4] As to these points
the Spartans and the other allies are agreed as has been said.
• ….” (Thuc. The Peloponnesian War 4.118)
The war itself had not been centered around Delphi, yet protection of Delphi was
the first thing mentioned in this treaty. This certainly points to Delphi’s
importance to both parties involved and their mutual desire to see its sacredness

preserved. Despite the war between them, they recognized that Delphi, as the
center of the world, belonged to all of Greece, and should be protected as such.
Politically, Delphi was represented by a panhellenic association of city-
states called the Amphictyonic League, or Delphic Amphictyony. The
Amphictyony governed the sacred area of Delphi, whose territory was
independent from the surrounding area of the Phocians. The Amphictyony had
the power to institute fines and declare sacred wars, often pertaining to claims
that the offending party cultivated sacred land. Having control of Delphi, which
was so centrally important to the Greek culture, was thus a source of much
power. Consequently, control of the Amphictyony was a source of struggle
between city-states. One case of this is given by Hornblower, who states that “it
was arguably in order to secure more direct control of an amphiktionic vote that
the Spartans founded a new city at Herakleia” (Horn., The Greek World p. 28).
Hornblower then continues on to argue that struggle for influence at Delphi
played a larger part in the First Peloponnesian War than some might believe.
On the other hand, while there was struggle between states over control at
Delphi, protection of Delphi as a panhellenic site was agreed upon by both sides,
as already illustrated by the terms of the treaty given above. In a sense, the care
of Delphi was seen as an obligation of the whole of Greece. The Sacred Wars,
although often politically motivated for other reasons, generally were fought in
order to free Delphi from the Phocians, who at various times took over Delphi
and its sanctuary. Plutarch describes how Solon gained popularity “with the
speech he made on the temple at Delphi, to the effect that the Greeks should not
stand idle while the Cirrhaeans violated the oracle, but should come to its
assistance and help the people of Delphi defend the god. In fact it was because
they were won over by his arguments that the member-states of the
Amphictyonic League went to war” (Plut., Solon 11). Thus the argument that
Greeks must protect the sanctity of Delphi was a convincing one, and an

argument that perhaps most Greeks would have agreed with. Delphi belonged to
all of Greece. They all contributed money to it’s upkeep and they contributed
troops to its defense.
As a symbol of panhellenism, Delphi’s influence and greatest period
followed closely with the rise and prominence of panhellenism. The history of the
Pythian oracle goes back at least as far as the seventh century BC, when Delphi
was declared independent, and the seat of the Amphictyony was moved there
(http://iam.classics.unc.edu/loci/del/16_hist.html). Delphi’s fame only continued
to grow with the prestige of the oracle, through the Persian Wars, through the
Peloponnesian War, throughout the ages when Greece was defined as a
collection of city-states. It was in the period after the panhellenic age that the
oracle thus started to decline. While there were still lots of visitors to Delphi and
the oracle in the period after Philip controlled all of Greece, the number of people
declined (http://www.aroundparnassos.com/history/). This would be the trend for
the rest of its existence, despite efforts from people like the Roman emperor
Hadrian, who undertook some building in Delphi in the early 2nd century AD.
While Delphi was not the center of an empire like Athens after the Persian
Wars, or like Sparta or Thebes after the Peloponnesian War, it was the center of
a greater culture of all Greeks. It was the center of the religious world, and the
center of a history which lasted longer than any empire the Athenians or
Spartans may have had. Delphi, truly was a place worthy of its title."

Reading Questions on Christian, Maps of Time, Chapter 11, “Approaching Modernity”
This is the first chapter of Part V, “The Modern Era: One World.” (Note that the title of this Part
gives a geographical emphasis to the emergence of “modernity” or, in Christian’s terminology,
“the Modern Revolution.” ) This chapter presents a long, analytical introduction to Christian’s
explanation of the “rise of the modern world,” which he describes in more detail in the next two
chapters.
How does Christian justify spending so much of his book to this very short period of time? Why
is this transformation more significant—for humanity and for the world—than any other to date?
Is it just beginning or almost over? Do we have a way of knowing? (335)
In the first section of the chapter Christian describes another type of mass extinction that humans
have caused: the extinction, in modern times, of many alternative forms of human societies, now
swept away by the Modern Revolution (top of 342, also top of 348). Describe the mix of
different types of human societies before this happened. In many cases, people who lived in
agricultural civilizations referred to others (foragers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, small-scale
farmers) as “barbarians.” What does this term mean? How did these “barbarians” typically live?
What are some of the most active and interesting points of contact and exchange among the
various types of pre-modern societies? What are some of the technologies, goods, and ideas that
were transferred among them? (336-341)
Review the major categories of change that make today’s world “utterly different from the world
of seven or eight hundred years ago” (342): population, productivity and energy supplies, ability
of states to impose power (through bureaucracies and also through violence), “transformed
lifeways,” new modes of consciousness, and acceleration of the pace of change, i.e. of history
itself. What are “lifeways”? How is this term different from “lifestyles”? Which of these
changes are predominantly material and which ones are predominantly cultural/psychic? How do
they connect, and what material changes underlie the more psychic ones? (Note on p. 359
Christian returns to these theme of connecting material and psychic changes when he discusses
the “disciplining” effects of capitalism.)
Which of these changes seems most significant to you? Are you convinced by Christian’s
argument that among new technologies, those relating to energy production and use are critical?
Are you convinced by his argument that the management of energy supplies presents particular
challenges just because of their apparent abundance? (342-351)
Christian tells us that the Modern Revolution is not an “out of Europe” phenomenon (that is, not
analogous to the human revolution, which came “out of Africa”) but a global one, from which
Europe happened to be in the best position to benefit. In other words, Christian is arguing that
history works differently than it used to because it has become global history. Keep this
hypothesis in mind as you read this and following chapters: are you persuaded? (351)
The main problem, he writes, is to account for the sudden, global acceleration in innovation,
which made it possible for civilizations to break out of the Malthusian cycles of lagging

productivity (as discussed in the last chapter). On the other hand, it makes contemporary
civilizations vulnerable to business cycles caused by overproduction: keep this in mind as we
discuss the possible “collapse” or “crash” of 20th century American power. (352)
Thereafter Christian walks us through the various explanations for the Modern Revolution, in
each case telling us why he finds them inadequate (not necessarily wrong, but not sufficient
either):
--demography
--geography (in the sense of resource availability, such as fossil fuels)
--ideals and inner motivations (e.g. Max Weber’s thesis)
--commercial exchanges (e.g. Adam “Smithian” emphasis on markets fostering division of labor
and thus innovation)
--social structure (e.g. Karl Marx on modes of production that promote innovation by
concentrating wealth in the hands of a few, who benefit from the profits when new techniques
are introduced, while leaving many people without means of production and so forced to sell
their labor)
This review of causes of modernity gives you a brief introduction to some of the most influential
social theorists of modern times (Weber, Smith, Marx, with living social scientists like Giddens ,
Wolf, and Mokyr in supporting roles). Make sure you understand their basic ideas of these
theorists. Note their approach to history: they are using historical evidence to understand the
origins and workings of modern society works. What gets left out of their account? (352-360)
The chapter concludes as Christian tells us what he has told us and what he is going to tell us
(“signposting”): he will present a synthetic global explanation for the Modern Revolution that
includes elements of the above plus an emphasis on an unprecedented global system of exchange
in information/knowledge which favored the Atlantic shores of Europe and North America as a
new global hub. Just as he had described Paleolithic societies as being “pre-adpated” for
agriculture, he will argue that western European societies were pre-adapted for
industrialization.(360-363)

The Peloponnesian War 21h.301
The Peloponnesian War:
The Struggle for Security
In the years leading up to the Peloponnesian War Greece was ridden with strife
and discord. This generated fear in the city-states that stood to lose influence and elicited
hope in those who stood to gain influence. The major players in the war were Athens and
Sparta, but most of the city-states on the Greek mainland and nearby islands were
involved at some point. The underlying motivation for the conflict was the desire for
security aggravated by the power shifts that arose in the aftermath of the Persian Wars.
Sparta and her allies initiated the conflict with a desire to protect themselves against the
newly demonstrated power of Athens. The dependence on alliances combined with the
inconsistent nature of the alliances themselves exacerbated the struggle for security.
Lastly, Athens’ pursuit of empire, itself founded in Athenian security, spiraled out of
control to prolong the war. These three security issues, the problems regarding Athens’
rise to power, the unstable systems of alliances pervading Greece, and the increasing
expansion of Athens, were instrumental in shaping the Peloponnesian War from start to
finish.
Sparta had been the dominant force in Hellas for a long time and Athens’ growing
power posed a terrific threat to that previously unrivalled strength. With a stratified,
militaristic system of government that had been in place for over 400 years1 the Spartan
system had developed a military far greater than any other in Greece. The hoplite army
was renowned in the Greek world, and indeed all of Spartan society was a dedicated war
machine. At the top of the social structure was a fighting class that was not allowed to
engage in agriculture or business, but was raised solely to be full-time hoplite soldiers.
At the bottom of the social hierarchy there was the lowest and also the largest class, the
helot slave population. These slaves performed agricultural labor and were therefore
extremely important to the survival of the rest of the population2.
Sparta’s slave population was its largest security issue and one they had been
unable to resolve despite centuries of internal conflict. The helots suffered brutal

The Peloponnesian War 21h.301
treatment and Sparta constantly feared that they would rise up. This was especially
worrisome when Sparta was at war, because if an attacker should move into its main
territory, the helots in addition to the attacking force could overwhelm Sparta’s military.
Sparta also could not afford to send any significant portion of its military far from its
main lands since it always had to be prepared to put down a revolt3. Sparta’s need to
maintain control at home made them reluctant to send forces north to fight the Persians in
the Persian Wars. Sparta’s military policies not only allowed Athens to become a force
to counter that of Sparta, but actually forced Athens to become a strong power.
Sparta’s traditional prowess can be seen in its control over the long-standing
Peloponnesian League, an alliance of city-states. The members of this league were
ostensibly equal, but Sparta held all of the power, as the league was founded on the
strength of Sparta’s hoplite military. Each city-state made a bilateral alliance with
Sparta, and swore to follow them. Sparta dictated when the league would go to war, in
which case Sparta would have complete control, even over each allied contingent.
Except when at war, each member of the league was autonomous4. The promise of elite
Spartan military support provided security for the member city-states, and Sparta had
additional forces it could call on in the event of a helot revolt.
Athens was not a weak power, but did not have the formidable reputation of
Sparta. However, Athens’ role during the Persian Wars and its aftermath set the stage for
the Peloponnesian War by demonstrating that Athens was a significant military force in
its own right. Whereas Sparta, in the southernmost region of the Greek mainland, had no
need to rush to combat the Persians in the far north, Athens was nearer to the invasion
and wanted to prevent the Persians from reaching Attica if at all possible for its own
security. Therefore, Athens was helping itself by advocating a Greek alliance and trying
to protect the northern city-states. With the famous military might of Sparta playing little
part in the fighting, Athens was able to demonstrate that its army was capable of
executing successful campaigns as well. The Persian Wars also showed Athens the
importance of a strong navy, and they began to build it up5.

The Peloponnesian War 21h.301
Athens’ performance against the Persians made them a leader among the Greek
city-states. Since the Persians had not been entirely driven out of Greek waters, many
city-states remained nervous about their defenses and they turned to Athens, who
developed a Greek alliance. Like the Peloponnesian League, this Delian League was
designed to be democratic, with the policy decided by an assembly in which each
member state had an equal vote, but Athens was really at its head. The Athenians
provided the commander for the Greek offensive, dictated the contributions of the other
states in the league, and were in charge of distributing those contributions. This setup left
Athens in control of the joint navy and large treasury of the league, further increasing
Athenian power. As time progressed, Athens began to exhibit more control over the
league and its members. While the initial members had voluntarily entered the league,
they were not allowed to leave the league, and new members were forced to join. Naxos
was the first to revolt and be “forced back to allegiance6” but was far from the last. The
money and manpower Athens received through the Delian League allowed her to begin
to develop an empire.
The Peloponnesian and Delian Leagues themselves generated security issues for
the Greek city-states. The highly unstable situation in Greece after the Persian Wars
caused each city-state to look towards securing its status and independence amidst the
turmoil. However, the security of one state was frequently dependent on others being
weak, and this created a severe, and potentially violent, conflict of interests. Greece was
particularly susceptible to security issues because it consisted of a large number of
independent city-states. Since none of these city-states, not even the dominating powers
of Sparta and Athens, were strong enough to establish sufficient control to stabilize the
power hierarchy in the region, and therefore the individual city-states felt safer having
others bound by treaty to bolster their own defenses.
Similarly, but on a larger scale, neither of the two competing leagues were able to
dominate the Greek world. This bred difficulties in maintaining the alliances by making
it easier to cross-over between them. Because the Peloponnesian and Delian leagues
opposed each other, a city-state that had a grievance within their league could often count
on the other to support the switch. This made the alliances themselves unreliable and a
6 Thucydides 1.98, pg 93

The Peloponnesian War 21h.301
security problem, even though they were originally instituted to reduce that same
problem.
The empirical tendencies of Athens were also driven by a need for security. As
the Athenians told Melos after devastating their land, “By conquering you we shall
increase not only the size but the security of our empire7”. On the military front, Athens
feared that a coalition of city-states would be able to subdue them. Athens’ economic
strength also depended on their relations with other city-states. “The inability of Attica
as a whole to feed a large population8”, composed as it was of infertile land9, meant that
resources had to be gained abroad. Accessibility to grain routes was necessary to feed the
population, and availability of friendly trading centers was essential for commerce.
Additionally, Athens needed to protect its lands and the resources they contained. Since
Athens had large amounts of territory on the sea, its navy was instrumental in protecting
its empire and commerce. Athens funded its formidable and expensive navy with tributes
taken from the lands under its control, making them indispensable in yet another way to
Athenian security. As Athens controlled more land, and therefore more resources, it also
required more protection and the process became cyclic. The need for military strength,
resources, and the protection of her assets made Athens’ continual territorial expansion a
measure taken to increase Athenian security.
These security issues began to build up once the Persian threat was gone. Despite
the alarm felt in response to Athens’ increasing power, the Spartans were reluctant to
make an offensive move without further provocation, due to their perpetual helot problem
at home. Sparta did try to subtly limit Athens’ expansion as early as 479 BC by trying to
convince them not to rebuild their walls when Athens tried to strengthen its position by
fortifying the city10, and even debated starting a war to prevent Athens from growing
stronger. Not too long after, though, the helots erupted with enough force that Sparta
actually called on Athens for help in putting down the slaves11. Athens came to aid
Spartans, and “it became clear to the Spartans that they themselves lacked experience in

this department of warfare12” and Sparta realized that they no longer had a monopoly
over military power on land, compounding their fear.
Athens’ new power threatened other city-states as well. Clearly, the city-states in
the Delian League that had tried to revolt and those that were forced into the league were
displeased with their loss of independence to Athens’ expansionist policies, as well as
those that feared they would be next. Sparta’s ally Megara used Athens’ power to aid in
a border dispute with Corinth by joining the Athenian alliance. A request for support
gave Athens a perfect excuse to set up garrisons, and so Athens was more than willing to
fight for Megara. The Corinthians’ security was hindered now that their rival was allied
with a power stronger than them, so this incident spawned Corinth’s anger with Athens13.
Eventually, fighting with Corinth, and also dealing with rebellions from Megara and
Euboea, Athens agreed to a truce. The revolts from within the Athenian alliance and
Megara’s defection from the Peloponnesian League demonstrate the unstable nature of
the alliances in Greece that added to the security dilemma of the city-states.
The truce did nothing to eliminate the security issues of the city-states around
Athens, but provided a good excuse for the hesitant Spartans to justify war with Athens.
A few years after the truce, claims were made that Athens had broken the truce. Aegina
claimed that Athens infringed on its independence, which was protected in the truce.
Megara claimed that Athens broke the truce with them in issuing the Megarian Decree,
which excluded them from trading with the Athenian empire14. The more decisive claims
were those Corinth brought against the Athenians, in regards to Epidamnus and Potidaea.
This is not to say that there was any more weight to Corinth’s claims, but that Corinth
itself had a significant amount of political influence. Corinth was a naval power, second
only to Athens, and therefore a powerful ally or enemy. Both Sparta and Athens were
dependent on their allies, Sparta because they needed a wide base of support to protect
themselves against their own slave population, and Athens because they needed the
tributes to fund their navy and the people to man the ships.
The dispute over Epidamnus reveals how the alliances, made for defense and
protection, actually produced a fear of conquest. Epidamnus was a tiny colony involved

in a civil war that had historical ties to both Corcyra and Corinth. Corcyra felt that
Corinth, who sent aid upon request to aid one of the warring parties, was interfering
without cause, and they turned to Athens for help against Corinth. Athens in turn feared
that Corinth, with its already strong navy, would win Corcyra’s substantial fleet and
weaken the margin of their naval superiority, so they established an alliance with
Corcyra. This alliance was supposed to be defensive, meaning that Athens would only
provide aid if Corinth was the attacker and Corcyra could not win on its own, because
offensive action against Corinth by Athens would break the truce. It turned out to be
difficult to distinguish between offensive and defensive actions, and allowed Corinth to
claim that Athens took offensive action against them, thus breaking the truce. The small,
relatively unimportant island was able to exploit its political connections for their own
purposes and set off a domino effect, drawing in multiple increasingly powerful allies and
severely escalating the civil war into a cause for a major inter-state war.
The next year, Athens attempt to tighten control over its tribute-paying ally
Potidaea created another cause for complaint against the rising power. The reason for
Athens’ ordering of Potidaea to tear down its walls and hand over hostages was an
Athenian fear that one revolt would trigger others in the area15 which would hurt Athens
politically and economically. Athens was acting to preserve the resources and tribute
garnered from her allies. Potidaea, promised help from Corinth and Sparta, refused the
demands and revolted along with others. Without support from Athens’ opponents,
Potidaea would have had no hope in winning a revolt and would have remained
submissive to the much stronger Athenian power. The result was that Athens and
Corinth were again openly fighting because of the instability of the alliances.
All of these cases claiming Athens had broken the truce were brought to Sparta,
where they were heard in council and debated. The Spartan king Archidamus’ analysis
of the relative strengths of the two powers concluded that it was highly unlikely that
Sparta could win a war with Athens. Sparta had no significant source of revenue, and it
would take time to build a navy to match that of Athens. Sparta’s strength was in her
land forces, which were incredibly effective in local conflicts but Athens had territory all
over Greece, much of which consisted of islands. Athens’ naval dominance and wealth

Final Paper: Cheryl Texin
The Peloponnesian War 21h.301
meant that Athens could always import supplies, so there was no chance of restricting
Athenian resources16. A Spartan victory required Athens to make a mistake. Despite
recognizing that the war was likely to favor Athens, the “Spartans voted that the treaty
had been broken and that war should be declared not so much because they were
influenced by the speeches of their allies as because they were afraid of the further
growth of Athenian power17”. Athens’ strength caused Sparta to fear for its security, and
the claims made against Athens provided the justification Sparta needed to finally take
action. Thus, at the outset of the Peloponnesian War, Sparta was acting to prevent further
Athenian expansion while Athens was trying to protect her empire.
Each party’s goals dictated their policy in implementing the war. Sparta wanted
to reduce Athenian power, or at least halt the growth of Athenian power. Sparta’s
strategy was to mount an attack on the countryside of Attica, knowing that it would be
difficult to take the fortified city of Athens. Sparta ravaged the land outside the walls
hoping that the Athenians would come out and fight rather than “allow their land to be
laid waste18”.
Under the leadership of Pericles, Athens’ goal was to protect its empire. Pericles
was known to be a cautious leader and one who did not take chances that put his troops at
unnecessary risk19 but his military aptitude was evident in his fifteen consecutive
appointments as military commander20. He designed and initiated a defensive plan for
Athens. Recognizing, as Archidamus did for Sparta21, that Sparta could not afford an
extensive engagement, Pericles decided to preserve his troops and focus on “[diverting]
most of their resources to guarding and securing what they already had22”. Expecting an
attack on Attica, Pericles brought the populace into the city, and sent out the navy to
counterattack on the coastal cities of the enemy. The navy was successful in its small
expeditions, but sentiment in Athens was factional23, and there were many who were

unsatisfied with his purely defensive strategy against Sparta24. Although Athens was in
name a democracy, Pericles was able to manipulate the people so that he was essentially
in complete control25 and was able to “pacify those who were spoiling for a fight26”.
The war was stalemated for two years as the Spartans burned farmland and the
Athenians waited them out until a plague swept through Athens. The plague demoralized
the Athenians, who were already angered at being crowded into close quarters in the city,
and they “became eager to make peace with Sparta and actually sent ambassadors
there27”. The plague also took the life of Pericles, and furthered the faction that was
vying to take an offensive. Cleon, “remarkable among the Athenians for the violence of
his character28”, came to power in Pericles’ place with aggressive plans. He believed that
assaulting Sparta itself would incite a helot riot, and force the Spartans to stay out of
Attica. The death of Pericles and the ensuing rise of the hawks in Athens spurred the
next phase of the war, with a series of major battles leading up to the Peace of Nicias.
The escalation of the war under Cleon was a solid indication that the Athenians
were allowing their war aims to grow beyond the original goal of defending what they
had. Athens occupied Pylos and fortified it. Sparta was unable to win Pylos back despite
hard fighting, and Athens ended up capturing some of the famed Spartan hoplites29. This
horrified the Spartans, and they immediately decided to “send ambassadors to Athens
with a view for ending the war30”. Athens, under the urging of Cleon and “aimed at
winning still more31” refused, and then initiated further expeditions against Spartan allies,
such as Corinth and Cythera32. Sparta was in serious trouble, having suffered multiple
defeats and fighting a war mainly on the sea and out of their realm of military expertise.
Still, the Athenians pressed on33. Sparta managed to win some victories at Delium and
Amphipolis, and with those setbacks combined with revolts from Athenian allies in the
north, Athens agreed to the Peace of Nicias.

The Peace of Nicias did not end the Peloponnesian War, however, as the
Athenians had not put aside their push for empire. The motivation for the war had
shifted, becoming a war of conquest by Athens. Sparta, while not entirely happy with the
peace, and fighting its allies who had refused to even agree to the treaty, had suffered too
many losses at the hands of the Athenians. The Spartans’ confidence had been shattered,
and they were not eager to return to combat34.
Athens, on the other hand, was overconfident. As previously described, Athenian
war aims had drastically increased over the first part of the war. The original move for
territorial expansion was founded in self-protection, but had spiraled out of control with
the successes already achieved inflating Athenian desire for more. The Sicilian
Expedition Athens developed was ostensibly to aid to their allies there who claimed the
Syracusans on the island were looking to “utterly [destroy] the power of Athens”, but was
in reality a mission of conquest35. Athens was excited to capture the grain and timber of
the island36, but knew nearly nothing about the island or the people living there37. Nicias
argued reasonably that Sicily would not be easy to conquer, and harder to control if it
was38. However, the Athenians were so focused on the benefits of a victory that they
refused to look closely at the possible hazards. The massive force sent over, looking
“like a demonstration of the power and greatness of Athens39”, failed to take the island.
The expedition had some successes early on, but was overall disastrous for Athens.
Alcibiades, one of the leaders, was recalled to Athens on the charge of mutilation of
Hermae prior to his departure. Rather than returning to Athens to stand trial, he defected
to Sparta and helped them relieve Sicily40. Alcibiades’ inside information allowed Sparta
to regain some of their vaunted military reputation with big victories against Athens.
Despite Nicias’ letter explaining the poor situation in Sicily and asking to be recalled,
Athens sent reinforcements41, and still Sparta shut them down. This renewed Sparta’s

confidence, and they designed an invasion into Attica itself42. Athens’ position kept
getting worse, as they suffered a huge defeat at Syracuse that effectively wiped out the
navy, but still Athens refused to cut their losses and back out. In the end, Athenian
“losses were, as they say, total; army, navy, everything was destroyed43”. Money was in
short supply, as most of the treasury had been used to support the expedition in the first
place. There were revolts all around the Aegean, encouraged by Alcibiades, and Sparta
was gaining momentum. The Spartans were able to set up a garrison in Attica itself at
Decelea and monetary support from the Persians allowed them to be successful at
building up their navy44. Athens now began to fall apart entirely, with the city erupting in
strife over the miserable failure of the Sicilian Expedition. Finally the Athenians were
able to pull out a victory at Arginusae, but Sparta was able to recover with the addition of
Persian support. In the final battle at Aegospotamoi Sparta captured nearly all of the
Athenian ships, and Athens was utterly defeated with their navy and food imports now
under Spartan control45. Sparta had become the sole dominant power in Greece once
again.
Sparta emerged victorious in the Peloponnesian War, and Athens was entirely
decimated. The treaty that resulted forced Athens to destroy her fortifications and
become a minor ally of Sparta46. She lost her empire so completely that she never
regained it. The city continued to enjoy a level of wealth, and as a center of culture she
still counted among the leading towns of Greece, but her political influence was never
again decisive. Sparta was now in an extremely advantageous position, having fulfilled
all of its war aims in breaking apart the Athenian empire.
Where did the Peloponnesian War turn sour for Athens? At the outset of the war
both Archidamus and Pericles arrived at the conclusion that Athens was superior in
military might, financial backing, and tactical position. Sparta’s military strategy was
founded on hope and as predicted Athens dominated every aspect of the fighting for
years. Pericles was “confident in ultimate victory” as long as Athens made no mistakes,

and contained their urge to “add to the empire while the war [was] in progress47”.
Unfortunately for Athens, Pericles died in the plague and no one heeded his words. With
Pericles in power, the war was extremely uneventful, but was also going extremely well
for Athens, and was likely to continue to go well. Pericles’ defensive plan was
strategically sound. The victories produced by the aggressive policies initiated after his
death made Athens overconfident and greedy, ultimately leading to the destruction of the
city’s political power.
Athens had multiple opportunities to exit the war in a better position than they had
been on entering it, but squandered their chances. Cleon refused to accept a Spartan
surrender after Pylos. At this point in the war, Sparta had yet to claim any significant
victory, and any treaty would have followed Athenian desires closely. Cleon’s rejection
of peace overtures from Sparta allowed them to win some battles fought out of
desperation and regain some morale before Athens settled for peace talks.
Despite this, the Peace of Nicias was largely in favor of Athens. The treaty
returned land taken in the fighting to the other side, and returned prisoners of war as
well48. This put the Greek city-states in a position very similar to that at the start of the
war, with the Athenian empire intact. At this point Sparta had failed to succeed in their
war aim, as they were unable to reduce the threat of the Athenian empire. Additionally,
the peace treaty hurt Sparta’s military reputation and angered her allies49. Athens had
fulfilled her original goal of maintaining the status quo. If Athens had kept in mind
Pericles’ warning against reaching for empire and let the Peace of Nicias stand, it could
have remained a significant power in Greece for decades to come.
The Athenians, however, had been overwhelmed with their success, and their
greed culminated in the disastrous Sicilian Expedition. Sicily was a mistake from the
very beginning, and demonstrates the extent to which Athens was overcome by the desire
to conquer. The recall of Alcibiades was a devastating error, not only depriving Athens
of its main proponent for the expedition, but also providing Sparta with valuable
information to use against Athens. Nicias had twice counseled Athens against the
expedition, prior to the war and in his letter advising retreat, but was not a strong enough

leader to force people to listen. After a hard won victory at Arginusae, Athens recalled
and executed its generals over a war crime, even though the war was still going on50. All
of these mistakes demonstrate how Athens was overcome with imperialism to the degree
of ignoring the reality of the situation. Pericles had originally laid out specific, attainable
goals for Athens, but after his death Athens simply wanted more. Had Pericles survived
to provide a persuasive voice of reason, perhaps Athens would have been satisfied with
the Peace of Nicias, since Nicias was unable to convince the people despite all his efforts.
Sparta was victorious in the Peloponnesian War but unable to make that victory
last. The Greek states rapidly fell into more squabbling, until Alexander came along and
conquered all of Greece and Persia. How could an Athenian victory have changed
history? If the plague had not taken the life of Pericles, would he have been able to
convince Athens that the Peace of Nicias should last? If Nicias had been more
persuasive, could he have done the same? Would a strong Athenian empire have taken
the place of Alexander in history, or had an entirely different result? There is no
definitive answer to these questions, but the speculation itself proposes the idea that a
small event, or a single person, could have a huge impact on the world. An event of the
magnitude of the Peloponnesian War must clearly have an even larger significance in
defining history throughout the ages that were to follow.
Security in many guises motivated the Peloponnesian War. The Persian Wars
shook up the Greek world and the unsteady situation produced drove each city-state to
take a close look at its own interests. Sparta was concerned that Athens’ newfound
power could rival its own historic dominance, and smaller city-states feared that Athenian
expansion would strip them of their independence. The Peloponnesian and Delian
Leagues, created to provide a network of support for their members, experienced too
many affiliation changes to be effective. Additionally, the backing of the alliances not
only encouraged city-states to engage in military operations, but caused small local
conflicts to expand and include a large portion of the Greek world. Athens, looking
forward to a future of power and influence, fed off its own successes and growing
strength until it ground itself into defeat. While we can never truly know what could

have happened if a few events were changed, history could have turned out entirely
different. The Peloponnesian War had a huge impact in its time, and long after as well.

"Founding Democracy
The democratic character of Solon's reforms
Panayiotis P. Mavrommatis
In the midst of a society swamped with science and technology, advertisement
and information, work and entertainment, consumerism and capitalism, a society that
has conquered everything from the genome to space, moments come when we turn to
notions that we take for granted – constitution, elections, democracy, and wonder
whether we should indeed take them for granted. Twenty-five centuries later, several
events make the world turn its attention to what Solon, Cleisthenes and their peers first
envisioned and attempted to apply, democracy, with fundamental questions such as
“how democratic is our society?”. Relevant to this philosophical and political question,
we can pose another one, more historical but also a bit philosophical at the end: How
democratic were the early reforms and specifically the very first of them, those of
Solon?
After a brief discussion of Solon and the reforms that are attributed to him, we
address the issue of defining democracy and trace the reasons why Solon’s reforms
can be considered as democratic. Finally, we explain why the reforms might not look
completely democratic given later notions of democracy.
Solon traveled a lot as a trader, before being named sole archon of Athens for a
number of reasons such as his background, personality and poetical abilities. Solon is
said to have introduced a number of reforms, aiming to bring order and stability to the
politically troubled Athens of the sixth century BC. Whether all the reforms we refer to
below were indeed established by Solon is a matter of dispute. Plutarch himself admits
that his statement about Solon’s founding of the Areopagus might be wrong since one
of Solon’s laws refers to the Areopagus as an office already present in the state.
1

Aristotle is also inconsistent at some points, as he mentions that Solon reformed the
selection of magistrates in The Athenian Constitution but in the Politics he claims that
no such change was made (Rhodes, A.C., Introduction). The above, along with some
differences between the two writers regarding Solon, generate the question whether
these reforms were indeed introduced by Solon. The answer to this question is not in
the scope of this paper; we will instead consider the reports of Aristotle and Plutarch as
valid and comment on the reforms they present to us.
The first major reform attributed to Solon is the “disbursement”, or seisactheia.
According to Plutarch, this was the cancellation of all debts, and Aristotle adds that the
“loans on security of the person” were banned. (A.C, p. 50) This reform affected both
rich and poor Athenians who had been involved in loans, mostly in favor of the poor.
Moreover, a significant number of citizens became free. The second reform was the
formation of four classes, based on the citizens’ wealth. A person belonged to the first
class if he could produce more than five hundred measures of goods, to the second
class for more than three hundred, to the third class for more than two hundred, and
everybody else belonged to the last class, the thetes. Members of the first three classes
could hold offices such as those of the archons and the treasurers. The last class
gathered at the assembly and could act as jury in court. Another reform of Solon was
the founding of the council of four hundred, the boulé. One hundred men from each of
the four traditional tribes of Athens, but only from the first three newly-formed classes,
formed the council that was responsible for processing public matters before bringing
them to the assembly. Finally, Solon’s legal reforms were also significant. Anyone could
appeal to the jury if a decision of the magistrates was not accepted. Furthermore, one
could seek justice for other persons who could not represent themselves.
These have been the main reforms characterized by several critics as
democratic. As already mentioned, however, no single definition of democracy exists; in
fact the issue is still open to many. A very rough listing of elements that are generally
considered democratic could be the following: A constitution that defines the power of
2

every public office, free and just elections for public offices, the right to vote and to be
elected, freedom of speech and press and equality before the law. In the light of these
elements, but keeping in mind the social, economic and political context of those
reforms, we attempt to present the reasons why Solon’s changes can be considered
democratic.
In short, democracy means power to the people. Solon introduced laws that gave
people what they urged for, power. Firstly, all four classes could participate in the body
of jurors that, according to Plutarch, turned out to be significantly powerful because
“most disputes came to the hands of these jurors” (Lives, Solon XVIII, p. 453). The
fact that Solon’s laws were not clear and simple might have been another reason why a
lot of disputes arose and a lot of cases ended up in the jury-court (Aristotle, A.C. p 50).
This practice is not uncommon even in modern law systems, where laws are written to
give general guidance to the judge or the jury who take the final decision. Apart from
the jury, the people were those who took the final decisions on crucial public matters, in
the form of the assembly in which every citizen was encouraged to join. In fact, Solon
introduced a controversial law punishing those who did not take part in public decisions
on crucial matters, following the view that everybody should care about public issues.
This law might not be accepted as democratic in general today, but it is still in dispute;
in a number of nations citizens are obligated to vote. Moreover, Solon introduced
elections for the appointment of public officers. According to Aristotle, the tribes elected
a number of candidates, and the final decision was based on lottery (A.C.). It should be
mentioned that a thete could not stand for election; however, the right to elect the
government officers is undeniably fundamental to democracy. Finally, Solon’s laws
decreased the power of the aristocratic archons and landlords of Attica. The seisactheia
clearly favored the poor over the rich, and the distribution of offices to members of the
middle classes reduced the power of the aristocracy. All these reforms, therefore, made
Solon’s constitution democratic in the literal sense of giving power to the people.
3

Apart from the power that Solon gave to the public, the introduction of the four
classes was an equally important step towards democracy. First, it was a step away
from aristocracy, since a citizen’s class was determined by wealth, and not by origin,
and all three upper classes could hold public offices. Secondly, Solon’s reforms gave
the potential, at least, for anyone to hold public offices and exercise authority. Through
hard work (or other means, of course), someone who would like to participate in politics
more actively could overcome the barrier of the two hundred measures of goods and
claim a position in the public offices. This was quite a revolutionary change from the
original “aristocratic” way that officers were appointed in the past. As Aristotle states,
officers’ appointment was solely based on the judgment of the Areiopagus, whose
members were former archons, thus the circle of archons and other officers would
remain closed. (A.C.)
Another reason why one might be tempted to describe Solon’s reforms as
democratic is the observation that these reforms have been the groundwork upon which
Cleisthenes and Pericles built and established democracy later. Elements such as the
assembly and the Boulé were enhanced by Cleisthenes, giving more power to the
people. Ephialtes and Pericles further decreased the power of the Areiopagus.
Moreover, the classification of citizens based on their property was taken a step further
by Cleisthenes to the formation of ten tribes, in which neither origin nor property
mattered, thus further decreasing the power of the rich. One could claim that
democracy could not have been built overnight or in the course of a few years and by a
single person. Rather, progressive men such as Solon, Cleisthenes, Pericles and the
demand of justice, equality and freedom from the people of Athens gradually gave rise
to what came to be known as democracy. In my view, Solon’s reforms could not have
been much more democratic at the time. Further reducing the power of the rich would
risk the acceptance of the reforms by the aristocracy, which would lead back to
oligarchy. This could be supported by the fact that, even though Solon’s reforms were
initially accepted, tyranny was not avoided a few years later.
4

These were the main reasons why people studying Solon and ancient Greece
have been tempted to characterize his laws as democratic. On the other hand, one
could argue that Solon’s constitution was not totally democratic as compared to the
commonly accepted notions of democracy today, but also then, in the fifth century B.C.
Firstly, only members of the three upper classes could hold public offices, for example
be a member of the council or become archons. This opposes the fundamental right to
be able to stand for election. This had another implication as well: A major portion of the
population was not represented directly, i.e. by some of its members, in the public
offices. Moreover, even within the three upper classes, the richest class had more
political rights than the other two. Aristotle mentions, for example, that the treasurers
had been appointed only from the highest class (A.C.). On the other hand, one could
claim that something similar is still in effect in many nations today. Everybody is indeed
free to stand for election, however, in order for one to have a substantial probability of
being elected, a number of “unofficial” prerequisites such as education, background,
occupation and even family origin exist.
In summary, this paper has discussed a number of reasons why one might be
tempted to characterize Solon’s reforms as democratic. The major arguments for this
claim are that Solon’s reforms included a number of democratic elements, and that they
were the basis for even more democratic changes later. The presence of a class
system, though, upon which political rights were distributed, might not allow us to
accept Solon’s constitution as a complete democracy. In any case, these reforms were
certainly a work of a wise man, carefully written to be accepted at the time and to last
throughout the ages, and one of the reasons why Solon was one of the seven sages of
ancient Greece.

On growing up.
Walter Benjamin, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche
Much as the study of the human brain benefits from a close examination of its
development, the study of the human psyche and thought process has much to gain from an
analysis of the thinker as he is growing up. It seems obvious, after all, that an individual‟s
perception should be affected by his experiences. Our very understanding of the objects
around us depends on our being able to name and categorize them, and to understand their
interrelation. We understand buildings, shelves, and water-glasses because we understand
gravity, and we understand complex social situations by having had experience with
people. Most importantly, through interacting with the world and forming memories of it,
we come to understand the boundaries of our mental and physical self. For that reason, a
child who has not yet learned the delimitations of his existence uses his surroundings to
gather meaning much as we use our memories.
Walter Benjamin‟s Berlin Childhood around 1900 gives insight on the process by
which the child narrows the generalizations with which he interprets the world around him.
This maturation of perception and understanding brings with it an enhanced ability to deal
with abstract concepts, to remove oneself from one‟s immediate situation and be able to
consider it at a metaphorical distance. There is also, however, something lost in this
increased systematization of thought. Though associative memory is useful for practical
1

applications, the wildly associative perception of a child provides for him a rich
imagination and fantasy, an interpretive power beyond that offered by logical analysis.
Berlin Childhood laments the loss of this mental agility as much as it simply remembers.
Not yet having learned to think of himself and of others in a way characteristic of
his time and place, little Walter is perhaps closer to the Nietzschean transcendence of his
world than can be any person deliberately trying to return to his state. Indeed, he
communicates with the world around him in a way that is closely reminiscent of
Nietzsche‟s field theory of energy. The spaces of his mind and his imagination are
sometimes even like those of Heidegger in his relationship to them. However, Walter uses
language and objects in a way that is not at all in keeping with Heidegger‟s theories. For a
young mind that has not yet been cluttered with experience and history, the metaphysical
and historical context of an object and its noun are insignificant in comparison to the
fantastical plotline he, personally, weaves around them.
Benjamin captures Walter at a state where he is not yet certain of the quality of his
own existence, or of the language he uses to describe it. The lack of precision of words,
however, holds in it a greater capacity for expression than does the original set of
meanings. While the correct grouping of the words Muhme Rehlen holds its own
background, for instance, the child‟s interpretation of them is fantastically more significant.
The mummerehlen calls up not the academic reference to an “old nursery rhyme that tells
of Muhme Rehlen,” but an allusion to a mythical creature that manifests its traces in “the
2

diamond-shaped pattern… of barley groats or tapica,” that draws connections between
various experiences. “The line is distorted,” as it has strayed far from its original meaning,
“yet it contains all of childhood” just as Proust‟s madeleine contained for him his memory
of his. The child has not at this point learned to use language as a tool common to all that
know it to some degree of sophistication. Instead, his words hold for him associations
formed by his previous interactions with the situations containing them. In a sense,
language becomes a vehicle for Proustian associative memory, as it is the first thing the
child finds present in all of his encounters, and therefore the first thing he allows himself to
generalize.
In this associative function of language, there is also a creative and transformative
power that is lost once the meanings and implications of words become more standard.
When Benjamin says that he “had learned to disguise [him]self in words, which really were
clouds,” he speaks for a highly subjective idea of language that is disconnected from the
mature and largely grammatical distinctions of subject and object, proper and common
noun. To be able to imitate a piece of furniture and to allow it to “distort” is to give the
furniture more power and presence than one would usually presume furniture to have. The
child marks no separation between himself and the world of objects around him. Walter is,
in fact, as much “distorted” by his surroundings as is the Muhme Rehlen‟s line “distorted”
by his misunderstanding of the words.
Walter‟s use of language also includes a transformative component that affects
people around him. “As far as I was concerned, [the street my aunt lived on] was not yet
3

named after Steglitz. It was the Stieglitz, the goldfinch, that gave it its name. And didn‟t my
good aunt live in her cage like a talking bird?” Whereas most people will not be
particularly concerned with the street names of their acquaintances unless they are
particularly far into Cheapside, Walter uses this street name to associate with his aunt‟s
presence a characterization of her personality, in terms of her knowledge of the people
around her and her willingness to share it. This reappropriation of language does not
require a modification of the constituent parts: the word, in this case is the same, and just
its associations different. It is, however, arguably in a much more useful context than the
originally intended one: the qualification of the aunt‟s personality is more evocative than
her mere physical location.
This freedom of language speaks against Heidegger‟s implication of a shared
etymological tradition that gives words their life and subliminal significance. It is, of
course, possible to analyze the expressions of a child in terms of their implied roots: “the
Old High German word thing” will still mean “gathering” regardless of its author. There
will always be a common implied set of meanings in language that comes from the process
of the formation of the language being used. It does not make sense, however, to analyze a
young child‟s language in terms of its historical context because a child‟s primary use of
words will be too subjective too be effectively summarized by anything common to anyone
outside of his direct sphere of interaction. Heidegger‟s understanding of language is too far
removed from the intention of the speaker to truly be representative: the speaker becomes
the combined historical tradition of the Western world.
4

In most applications, it may be useful to examine a historical context for the
language being used, as it provides insight into the palpable meaning of the expressions.
This approach is more applicable, however, when the person in question has enough
experience with the language to be versed in its proper use. The condition of intelligibility
does not apply to a child in the same way that it does to an adult for the simple reason that
the child may not be trying to express the same thing. As a person grows older, his
experience with language allows him to begin to participate in the tradition of its history.
His use of words will reflect the way that he has been taught to use them, and intuitively
therefore allow insight into the way he conceptualizes the ideas he is expressing. A child,
however, will use language in a way that is personal to himself: in a sense, he can be said
to use his own language and method of. Walter‟s mummerehlen has little to do with the
Mummer Rehlen regardless of its etymological roots.
Of course, language is not the only thing allowing Walter his imaginative capacity:
some elements of pure fantasy intercede without assistance. Nothing is only what it seems,
in his world: the shadow of a wolf‟s jaws are “so vast and so gaping that they must have
denoted the wolf Fenrir, which I, as world destroyer, set prowling in the… room.” The
hippopotamus at the zoo “dwelt in its pagoda like a tribal sorcerer on the point of merging
bodily with the demon he serves.” The presence of things novel to Walter‟s world inspire
the creation of a story for their existence. There is a curious blending of dream and reality
5

that shapes the world around him to reflect the emotional content of thoughts that he
perhaps cannot yet put into words.
Some visual hallucinations serve as better representations of Walter‟s feelings than
can any collection of words. His feeling of being reprimanded for being late to school, for
instance, is more succinctly served by the statement that “the clock in the schoolyard wore
an injured look because of [his] offense” that it would have been by any verbal admission
of guilt or penance. Modern-day expression of emotion is largely dependent on an ordered
set of phrases that correspond to particular emotional states. These states can be crudely
described with one-word labels that hold specific but complicated meanings. Using any one
of them to describe a state of being requires a separate set of qualifications. Walter‟s
method of visual analogy is no less accurate in describing his state of mind than is a
detailed verbal description provided by someone more adult.
Implied in the use of fictional scenarios to describe his emotion is a closer
relationship with the characters and objects involved than would be allowed by the adult
psyche. The representation of mental states as physical occurrences is something that we
tend towards only in metaphor, and yet it is quite commonplace in Walter‟s conception of
self. It is possible that the child has not yet learned to make the distinction between himself
and his surroundings to an extent that would allow him to disengage himself entirely from
them. Walter‟s incomplete definition of the boundaries of his existence and of the existence
of things around him is more evocative of a Nietzschean perception of fields of energy than
it is of a more traditional distinction of subject and object. Thus, Walter finds himself
6

interacting directly with things that are not within the adult‟s domain of conscious thought.
The snowflakes he observes through the window are not the symmetrical crystalline
remnants of a distant cloud: they are individual in a way that one only truly comes to
understand by studying many separate specimens, and yet that Walter intrinsically grasps.
The white monotony of their congregation develops into bands of snowflakes with which
Walter is able to ally himself “as intimately as possible.”
Unlike the spontaneous and involuntary memories and associations experiences by
Proust, however, Walter‟s incorporation of self into his surroundings has a strong voluntary
component. Walter‟s transcendence stems from his extreme awareness of the pure physical
presence of the things he interacts with: when he sees something for its intended purpose
and not for its presence in and of itself, his transformation does not occur. “The dining
table under which he has crawled turns him into the wooden idol of the temple,” a mask
that he cannot shake but with a violent “cry of self-liberation.” Walter is able to
deliberately forgo that arrangement by noticing the hiding places in his house for their
virtue as hiding places alone. However, there is a primal quality to the “demon that has
transformed [him]” that threatens to engulf him if he is not quick enough to escape,
speaking to a power inherent in these objects that the child alone can recognize because he
is not yet limited to perceiving things in terms of their purpose alone.
The snowflakes can hardly be said to be just snowflakes at this point: they have
transcended their literal definition. Indeed, the child may be said to use words differently
7

by sheer virtue of having a different understanding of their objects. It is also at this point
impossible to say that the child has a conception of objects that corresponds to Heidegger‟s
four-fold, as Heidegger‟s definition of an object rests largely on its function. Heidegger‟s
jug is a jug by virtue of containing and pouring out, while Benjamin‟s jug is likely to be the
jug on his grandmother‟s table.
It is surprising how much Walter is able to perceive and think of at once: while he is
paying careful attention to the snowflakes, he is also able to feel the greater consequences
of the snowstorm. “Distance, when it snows, leads no longer out into the world by rather
within,” where the physical demarcation of one‟s environment presents an individual with
the situational security necessary for him to allow his mind to expand into other geographic
frontiers. Much as Virginia Woolf‟s candles draw reflections in the windows and bring
together the guests at her dinner party into a finally cohesive whole, the white snow-shroud
brings all of Walter‟s stories to crowd around him and “play familiarly among themselves,
like the snowflakes,” from the gathering of which he is able to wander freely among the
distant lands he has imagined.
The books Walter reads and handles as a child are not to be merely read: they are
entities in and of themselves, with landscapes of “ridges and terraces” and self-contained
personalities. Walter‟s memories of the stories within them are very personal and quite
physical in nature: one does not get the impression that he recalls characters frolicking in
all of those diverse lands, but rather that he imagines his own presence in them. Perhaps he
8

is always somewhat present in those distant lands, with his “heart [that] has forever kept
faith with the well-thumbed volumes.” As Heidegger allows for the perception and
presence in space by his own peculiar sort of expansion that places him on both sides of his
metaphorical door, Benjamin‟s child is similarly present in all of the places that he has at
some point imagined. The distinction to be made is that Walter‟s presence in space is as
much a presence in space that does not actually exist: boy‟s books of old with “stormy
goings-on” that exist in his dreams and yet are never opened are as much his dwelling place
as is his physical inhabitation.
This subjectivity of perception, nevertheless, is not entirely lost in the process of
one‟s growing up. What is lost is more likely to be the reasoning behind a similar set of
emotions. Walter‟s regard of the postcards sent by his grandmother and his resulting
perception of the places they came from are not so hard to understand. Though it may be
difficult for a concretely-thinking person to look at the handwriting on a postcard and think
that the “places as so entirely occupied by [his] grandmother that they become colonies of”
her residence, the sentiment is easy to relate to: not having been to the locations depicted
on the postcards, a person will likely draw his experience of them largely from these
postcards. His thoughts and recollections of them, therefore, will be very much influenced
by this initial experience with them. As an adult, one may use the logical train of thought to
arrive at a conclusion more or less similar to the one that Walter experienced initially- it is,
however, a conclusion as detached from actual experience as is the representation of a
feeling in writing.
9

All of this is not to say that there is nothing gained from growing up. The gaining of
experience over time allows the individual an understanding of himself and of the world
around him that while likely beginning on an academic level, will hopefully eventually
transcend to a true change in perspective. As one ceases to be a child, one learns to live by
the laws of the world around him. It takes more time, however, to learn that the laws
concerning thought and action are not the natural laws that mean “that something cannot
also be something else … that it is neither free nor the reverse, but merely thus or thus.”
There are certain aspects of life and human interaction that children do not
understand whose true conception seems to come only with experience and time. The
Cavalier‟s song that Walter is promised to “understand when [he is] grown up” does not
hold any meaning to him until he is older, for instance, and has learned about the meanings
of love and death and how they apply to him. Benjamin describes this to be a semantic
understanding, however, more than it is meaningful in any real way: “the empty grave and
the heart weighed in the balance [are] two enigmas to which life still owes [him] the
solution.” It is not to be doubted that having an understanding of the process of death, a
lengthy contemplation of its effects on self and others, allows one a greater familiarity with
the concept and perhaps even an acceptance of it. These are not, however, things that allow
us to relate to its implications.
The little boy‟s admiration of Luise von Landau and her subsequent death were not
things that he, as a child, could fully comprehend. To compensate, he created a monument
10

for her in his imaginative interpretation of “the flowerbed on the riverbank,” a space
“resplendent and inviolable” as his memory of her. As Walter was growing up, he “never
set foot” on that distant and inviolable flower bank. He came back to it later, presumably
having some greater understanding of his feelings, and yet was not able to glean any
greater consolation. When he came to “pass quite close to the flowerbed,” or to look love
and death in the face, “it seemed to bloom less often.” His academic insight and dissection
of spiritual phenomena gave him no real comfort, until he came to realize that
understanding the Cavalier‟s song did not give him any insight into its true meaning.
In some sense, little Walter‟s relationship to love was as sophisticated as it could
get. Walter understood very early the difference between idealistic expectation and the
realities of his world. “How much was promised by the name „Court Hunters‟ Lane,‟ and
how little it held. How often I searched in vain among the bushes” for something that only
there in imagination, and how often one finds himself disappointed by looking in another
person for something that one may only truly find within himself. Walter learns the
inaccessibility of his ideals by being unable to reach the statues and crocuses of which he
comes to be enamored. He learns that the object of his true affections is unattainable, and
that his attempts to reach it will more likely than not fail to bring him the satisfaction he
imagines. As a child, he cannot dream to walk up to his beloved statue because there is a
stream in the way- and he cannot stray from his governess to explore the Luise‟s
flowerbed. “Thus, coldly, the princely had to rest upon the beautiful” that was not to be
11

reached. What is a physical reality translates to a mental one as well: the unattainable is,
after all, unattainable.
As an adult, Walter attempted to push the boundaries of his dominion and explore
the flowerbed, “but now it seemed to bloom less often… and no longer did it know the
name which we had once together honored.” The unattainable was no less unattainable for
attempts to attain it: indeed, the thing Walter came to forget as an adult is that it was he
who “wove together [this garden plot] so intimately with the beloved name.” The
knowledge and understanding gained during his maturation in some cases served to
undermine understanding that was already present.
Though Nietzsche speaks of the individual in terms of a field of energy that
interpenetrates all the energy fields around it, he allows for a limitation of one‟s existence
through the process of expansion and contraction. A child who is just begging to explore
the world around him will not have yet established the balance between these two functions
of his self, and is thus able to lose himself with unfathomable ease. In terms of perception,
the child will generalize with insufficient specificity. Not yet aware of the full background
of the words he uses, he creates his own associative language that serves him just as well.
The child, therefore, finds himself in a world quite different from that of the adults, and
only gradually introduces common terms that will lead him to a theoretically more
enlightened state.
12

Growing up, while it allows the child to understand on a very mechanical level the
workings of the world around him, does not allow any more true insight into its
motivations and thoughts than was present in the child initially. What a child has lost in his
maturation is what philosophy attempts to gain through years of deep and arduous thought.
How long did it take Nietzsche to come up with the idea that all objects interact with each
other, and all have the same basic capacity and power to affect change? A child will
understand this, inherently, before he learns the names and interactions of the objects he
encounters.
Of course, an understanding of the world is insufficient in and of itself, as a child
does not yet possess the tools to be able to explain the more contrived interactions around
him that are just as important by virtue of their presence. Heidegger‟s language comes to be
useful in this situation, as it allows a common context for the expression of thoughts
coming from different sources. The problem is that the etymological understanding of
language is limited in range to the subset of its users and audience who are likely to find it
relevant. A child who uses words in his own manner may very well find it more convenient
to express himself with images and fantastical plotlines the moral of which we may be left
to ponder, and in this may even speak with greater specificity.
It is, however, obviously not possible to express everything with images, and even
less possible to create parables with morals corresponding to each message that one wishes
to convey. What growing up really allows the individual, then, is the power of abstraction
from his immediate context by use of a standardized set of tools in his perception and his
13

language. Some perceptual delicacies are lost in the acquisition of these tools, and perhaps
fewer are gained. The process allows the individual to begin to recapture his original,
inherent manner of thought and perception in a way that becomes directly applicable to
both the physical and metaphysical aspects of his surroundings. What is lost in fantasy is
made up by a more precise expression of emotion, and what is lost in associativity is
compensated by the accumulation of memories that converse among each other in a similar
way. The adult, thus, is able to remain fundamentally the same person as the child, but
looks out through a different, ever-adjustable mask.

"Stathis Metsovitis
21H.301 The Ancient World: Greece
Paper #1
5/10/05
Is Really Achilles a Hero?
The Iliad is not a work that gives a mere account of historic facts and
events but one where persons are the protagonists by virtue of their behaviors,
values, motives and decisions which affect the flow of the story. Achilles is one of
these persons that play a primary role in the plot of Iliad; as Homer puts it in the
first lines of this work, the anger (mênin) of Achilles, his withdrawal from the
battles and the devastating effects that this has on the Greek army will be the
core of the story. Achilles appears in the story as a complicated character with
his own idiosyncrasy and system of ideals that sometimes no one else but him
can understand. This system of values is exactly what I am going to explore in
this paper. In particular, I will look at these values and examine how they affect
Achilles’ dramatic decisions and the people around him. However, I will
especially focus on the characterization of these values from the point of view of
the following questions: Is it worth abiding by this system of values as firmly as
Achilles does? What does Achilles not accomplish in his life by adopting these
ideals? Is this the best way for one to live? My response to these questions will
seriously question this system, for it leads to obdurate, cruel, mindless behaviors
that do not befit either a humane, minded individual or an inspired leader.
The first step in this exploration will be to locate Achilles’ values in the text.
In the Iliad, as a whole, Achilles reflects a paradigm of the hero that has fallen in
deep love with honor and glory. Behind every action or decision of Achilles lies
his thirst for everlasting timé (honor) and reputation, and this single-mindedness
and persistence permeate the whole story. In [1], A 302, and [1], A 352-355,
Achilles maintains that the prizes from his battles are evidence of his glory and
the loss of these prizes as a result of Agamemnon’s orders disgraces him. As a
result, he attempts to prevent the loss of Briseis at all costs; he does not even
hesitate to pray for the destruction of the Greek army and Agamemnon, as a
i

Stathis Metsovitis
means of making the king understand his mistake and restore Achilles’ timé in
the eyes of his fellows. The latter scene repeats in [1], I 374-409, however, here
we have two more important facts. Achilles corroborates, in his response to the
delegation that visited him, that the cause for his wrath is neither the loss of his
wealth nor of Briseis, but the deprivation of his rightful spoils. In his mind, this
action degrades his achievements in combat and harms his prestige; this
prestige is exactly what Achilles pursues in his life and he seems to lose it as an
effect of Agamemnon’s behavior. Also, the acceptance of Agamemnon’s gifts to
return to the battlefield may make him wealthier, but result in a greater loss of
honor, therefore he rejects them. A few lines later, [1], I 398-402, Achilles
becomes even more emphatic: he stresses that the motive for his participation in
the Trojan War is not the love for wealth, since his father Peleus was rich
enough, but his hunt for glory and pride, which would distinguish him from all
others. In [1], I 415 he ends up saying that a life without timé is pointless and in
[1], I 647-648 he proclaims to Aias that Agamemnon humiliated him. On the
same note, on hearing about the demise of his intimate friend Patroclus, in [1], Σ
112-117, he defies death and swears to take revenge for the loss of Patroclus,
because he believes that in this way he will receive even more glory.
Nevertheless, glory and honor for a Mycenaean man are not only
achieved in the battle field. Nobility, sincerity, politeness and respect to gods, his
parents and other men are also important for Mycenaeans and Achilles exhibits
these qualities in every occasion. He shows respect and modesty before the
gods by obeying their orders even if they are contrary to his will; for instance in
[1], A 215-218 the intervention of Athena prevents Achilles from assassinating
Agamemnon and in [1], Ω 139-141 he agrees to stop the desecration of Hector’s
body after the exhortation of his mother, goddess Thetis. Additionally, he
manifests his love and devotion to his comrades in [1], I 323 and he talks
courageously and sincerely, expressing clearly his opinions, as is seen in [1], A
149-171 and in [1], I 309.
However, what we see in book Ω is much more critical when trying to
identify Achilles’ code of values. In the beginning of this book Achilles exhibits an
ii

Stathis Metsovitis
atrocious and vindictive behavior, which contradicts the traits of an ancient hero
as they were described above, by desecrating dead Hector. Everything seems to
change though, when Priam, the father of dead Hector, comes to Achilles with
gifts, entreating for his dead son’s corpse. Achilles, after a divine intervention,
softens his anger and not only accepts the offer but also welcomes Priam
warmly, according to all the institutions of xènia. This entirely different second
face of Achilles showing measured humanity should not be surpsiring; Achilles
has now an excellent opportunity to recover his heroic virtues. By giving back the
corpse of Hector to Priam, he shows nobility and respect to the elderly and the
foreign leader. Moreover, by having the foreign king visit and entreat him with
gifts, Achilles feels that he is still important and respectful in the eyes of others.
This visit breaks Achilles’ long isolation and restores some of his lost kleos
(glory), and this explains his acceptance of the offer. This is essentialy the same
role that Achilles plays in book Ψ, where as a preeminent social leader and
umpire, organizes funeral games in remembrance of Patroclus.
Having mentioned the values that Achilles exhibits in the Iliad, I am now
going to examine more closely the effects they have on the people around him,
both Greeks and Trojans. The analysis here is essential, for it will help us
understand how things would be different if Achilles was more humane and less
rigid earlier in the story. According to Homer’s narration in the beginning of the
Iliad ([1], A 10-12), Greeks have already suffered much by the god-driven plague
caused by the abduction of Chryseis, the daughter of the god-loved priest
Chryses. As we see in [1], A 303-310, Agamemnon finally agrees to give
Chryseis back to her father, but just as Greeks were expecting a better day to
come in their camp, two evils hit them. The first is Achilles’ subsequent
withdrawal from the battlefield, which emboldens Trojans and discourages Greek
soldiers, since they now fight without one of their best warriors. However, even
worse is a second god-driven plague, caused by Achilles’ prayers. The ill-
tempered Achilles is once more not thinking as a “community man” but rather on
his own. Living in his single-mindedness, he is only determined to achieve his
iii

Stathis Metsovitis
personal goals, namely unlimited kleos, being indifferent to the outcome and the
effects on others.
In addition, Patroclus’ demise and Achilles’ subsequent decision to join the
Greek army again can be regarded as a consequence of Achilles’ compliance
with a problematic system of values. It is because of his complex that Achilles
does not enter the war himself. Instead, he sends his loyal companion to the
battlefield, indirectly contributing to his death. Patroclus’s death stimulates
Achilles to reconsider his attitude towards his comrades. On the one hand, he
feels remorse and embarrassment for not going to the battlefield himself and
having sent Patroclus instead. On the other hand, his thirst for glory is
unquenchable. Nothing else but this thirst is what makes him terminate the
estrangement from his fellow Greeks. According to Achilles’ moral code, if he
manages to kill Hector and take revenge for Patroclus’ loss he will be honored.
Therefore an outraged Achilles makes the big decision to join his comrades and
take revenge for his friend’s death. He fights with bitter hatred and kills Hector,
thus giving courage to Greeks and spreading sorrow in Troy. At this stage
however, the mutilation of Hector’s corpse dehumanizes Achilles’ morals.
Achilles abandons the noble qualities of a social hero and becomes disrespectful,
a man without feelings. It is only because of the Gods’ intervention that he stops.
Having analyzed the ideals and the motives of Achilles as well as their
consequences in the evolution of the story, we are able now to focus on the
major questions that were raised at the start of this paper. Achilles remains
throughout the Iliad faithful to the system of values which was described above.
By adhering to it he may obtain what every Mycenaean parent wishes for his son,
through the inherited code of ideals, namely timé and kléos. Nonetheless, we
should be wondering whether this blind adherence goes to extremes and
whether there are also other equally important things that an ancient Greek male
aristocrat should seek in his life [3]. Achilles is a supernatural warrior who seems
to have been isolated from his social environment. Before his own eyes, his
actions seem heroic, but meanwhile few of his fellows understand them; thus
Achilles cannot be considered as a community man. More precisely, these
iv

Stathis Metsovitis
actions are not balanced on the basis of their consequences on society, but on
his personal code of values, which is excessively rigid, focused on how to
become first and distinguish oneself from others. It is not astonishing therefore
that Achilles seems to ignore the happiness of everyday life and the heroism one
can show in his daily routine. Indisputably Achilles’ life is a heroic life, with the
narrow Mycenaean meaning of the term, but it is very doubtful whether it is also a
happy life, since Achilles is tightly engaged in his personal conflicts and peculiar
ideology.
The incidence that gives valuable insight in Achilles’ attitude towards life is
the delivery of his new shield by his mother Thetis ([1], T 13-28). Achilles gazes it
frivolously, merely as a nice piece of warfare equipment, and totally ignores the
import behind the impressive engravings. This elaborate shield mostly depicts
scenes of the everyday life of a peaceful polis (city) and its residents ([1], Σ
490~); scenes full of joy illustrating young people dancing and participating in rich
banquets; in other instances people are resolving their differences peacefully in
law-courts, despite their passions and anger. There are also scenes with
ordinary, though admirable, people working on the fields, struggling honorably for
their living without killing others in battles and looting their properties. In spite of
the fact that the struggle of people in their workplaces bears disappointments
since their efforts are not always rewarded, people continue, in a heroic context,
their efforts to render their lives more comfortable ([1], Σ 573-587). People of a
peaceful polis exhibit an everyday modest heroism and admirable dignity in their
efforts to overcome the obstacles in their work and relations, in order to build up
a healthy, self-sufficient and harmonic community with their peers. It is exactly
this kind of humane heroism that Achilles does neither possess nor appreciate.
Because not only in war but also in daily life, are there positions of honor, prizes
and rewards that make an individual stand out from the others. Public recognition
and rewards can also be regarded as fruits of hard work, social responsibility,
proper treatment of fellow citizens, wisdom and eloquence. Not only is there the
paradigm of Nestor, the anax (king) of Pylos, in the Iliad, who is admired for
showing all these qualities but also the scene of the law-court ([1], Σ 497-508)
v

Stathis Metsovitis
that makes this clear. On the one hand, the jury of this law-court consists of
respectful seniors who have excelled both in battle and city life, having thus
obtained the privilege to distribute justice. On the other hand, the litigant parties
provide arguments in order to convince the jury about their right. The winning
party will obtain wealth but more importantly he will obtain more honor and
appreciation from his peers. On the contrary, the polis in war, as depicted on the
shield, is a heartbreaking scene which is little described by Homer. This picture
illustrates to a great extent the life Achilles has chosen to live. Therefore, Achilles
neglects the peaceful life his shield puts forward and instead he picks up his
weapons and rushes into the battle ready to redeem himself by killing Hector.
Much in contrast with the hectic and violent life of Achilles comes the
somewhat measured life of Hector. While being a hero in the battlefield, Hector is
also a domestic and communal figure, thus deserving additional respect. In book
Z we see Hector being a tender father and husband, not hesitating to express his
human feelings and trying to provide reasons for his decisions to Andromache.
On the contrary, Achilles is isolated from his peers and only the presence of
Patroclus keeps him socially alive. In his life there are absolutely no scenes like
the ones that Hector experiences. Social responsibility, affection and love are
absent from Achilles’ life. Even in the case of Briseis, it is evident that he sees
her more as a prize of war than as a wife. Moreover, he feels no need to justify
his decisions to anyone because these are made only on the basis of his set of
values. As a result, Achilles may be admirable for his battle achievements but he
is still incomprehensible by his peers.
From another point of view, many things would be different if Achilles were
not so idiosyncratic, both for him and his peers. Sacrificing his own goal for more
and more pride and yielding to the common good would render him even more
admirable in the future and of course would have preempted the additional pain
Greeks suffered because of his decisions. Then Achilles would not only be a
hero for himself but also a societal hero, forming an integrated paradigm of
heroism both in the battlefield and community. Moreover, should he have
adopted a more approachable, less honor-obsessed, humane and modest
vi

Stathis Metsovitis
attitude of living, he would be able to resolve his inner conflicts which prevented
him from living a happy life. In addition, he could have prevented the loss of his
best friend Patroclus, which can be attributed in some sense to his withdrawal
from the Greek army. It is worth noticing how humane Achilles becomes after
talking with Priam in his tent ([1], Ω 500~), when he seems to realize how bad
human pain is and that there are other noble qualities that one must possess to
be a hero in the whole meaning of the term.
In conclusion, Achilles’ hunting of excessive honor and glory deprive him
of living a balanced life. Achilles’ may be admired for his boldness in battle, but
on the other hand he has little to show in his social and family life, since he’s little
concerned about the effects of his actions on others. He is overly hot-tempered
and addicted to his code of values, which does not allow him to pursue any other
goals which ought to characterize the life of a human being. This obsession
sometimes demoralizes Achilles and makes him even ferocious. Therefore, the
system of ideals that Achilles has chosen to follow, let alone his way of adhering
to it, should be rejected.

The Lewis Report, 1949:
In our increasingly complex society, science
and technology can no longer be segregated
from their human and social consequences.
The most difficult and complicated problems
confronting our generation are in the field of
the humanities and social sciences…they
have resulted in large measure from the
impact of science and technology upon
society…

The human-built world:
“We are well on our way, in our timeless
effort to bring the natural environment
under control, to replacing it by an
artificial environment of our own
contriving.”
MIT historian Elting Morison, 1946

Doc Lewis, in his older years:
“If I could be reincarnated, I would like to
return as a social scientist. That is
where the really difficult and important
problems are.”

Lives of the Emperors
Aurelius Victor, 24
The emperors after [Severus Alexander],
more concerned with tyrannizing their
subjects than subduing foreign peoples, and
with warring among themselves, precipitated
the Roman state into a steep decline. Then
good men and bad, nobles and low-born, and
even many barbarians, were indiscriminately
elevated to the purple.

Modernism
Sex and Knowing in the Modern World
D.H. Lawrence’s Odour of Chrysanthemums1 and Kafka’s The Trial depict very different worlds.
The former is a portrayal of Elizabeth Bates, a woman confronted with the death of her coal miner
husband. It is largely a realistic story in that its physical and social dynamics closely mirror those of our
own world. Indeed, many of the details are drawn from Lawrence’s own life. In contrast, The Trial’s
protagonist, K., attempts to navigate the surreally draconian workings of a modern bureaucracy. The
texts’ tones similarly differ: Chrysanthemums’s vivid descriptions of characters’ thoughts and feelings
connect us to full‐fledged human beings whereas The Trial’s elliptical factualness causes its characters to
seem distant; the surreal nature of the events The Trial only increases their otherness. However, despite
such differences, each work seeks to describe the barriers between the self and others, and, indeed, the
barriers within the self. Sex strengthens these barriers, primarily by giving the illusion of intimacy.
Elizabeth and K., however, meet with different fates. The death of Elizabeth’s husband gives her a
renewed, albeit dark, understanding of the world, while K. is unable to transcend his ignorance and is
executed. Ultimately, Chysanthemums and The Trial depict a common struggle to understand human
nature in a world confused by sex and delimited by mechanistic and bureaucratic structure, but their
distinct tones lead their protagonists to different ends.
Chrysthanthemums depicts a woman coming to understand how little she knew of her husband.
The first part of the story is an indirect description of Elizabeth’s perception of the relationship. She says
to her daughter, “if your father comes he’ll carry on and say there never is a fire when a man comes
home sweating from the pit.—A public‐house is always warm enough” (8). These bitter lines show that
Elizabeth expects an argument when her husband returns; to her, he seems ungrateful, preferring drink
1 For the page numbers, I am using the online text from:
http://odour.nottingham.ac.uk/view.asp?version=D&page=1 . This matches the version of the text linked to on the
syllabus, though it seems as though there are some other versions.

to his family. From the outset, though, small pieces of evidence accumulate against her explanation for
his late return. When asking her daughter about her husband, her daughter replies “Has he come up an’
gone past, to Old Brinsely? He hasn’t, mother, ‘cos I never saw him” (7). Elizabeth dismisses this fact,
saying “he’d take care as you didn’t see him, child” (7). However, for a man who was “heered… in the
‘Lord Nelson’ braggin’ as he was going to spend that b‐‐‐‐afore he went” (5), such caution seems
strange. Later, when she goes to visit the Rigleys, Mrs. Rigley says, “Oh, Jack’s been ‘ome an ‘ad ‘is
dinner long since” (13), making her husband’s disappearance even more disturbing. Elizabeth is not
oblivious to such clues, and her “anger” starts to become “tinged with fear” (12). However, she
nonetheless perseveres with her explanation for her husband’s lateness. As a consequence, she makes a
number of predictions which ominously foreshadow his death. For instance, she says “Eh, he’ll not come
now till they bring him… He needn’t come rolling in here in his pit‐dirt, for I won’t wash him. He can lie
on the floor” (10). Indeed, her husband is brought in and laid on the floor. Further, while Elizabeth
intends “pit‐dirt” to refer to the mine, it also suggests the dirt of the pit where his body will eventually
be laid to rest. Elizabeth’s predictions reflect her imperfect understanding of her husband: they are true
on a superficial level, but entirely wrong in their judgment of his character. Just as she does not predict
why her husband will be “brought in,” so too is she ignorant of the troubles which impel him to quarrel
and drink.
The second half of the story describes Elizabeth’s realization of the vast distance between
herself and her husband. When she sees his body, she knows that “Life with its smoky burning gone
from him, had left him apart and utterly alien to her” (27). Devoid of life, his body takes on an aura of
otherness to her. Yet, this otherness had always been present in their relationship; it had only been
masked by the “smoke” of life: he was a “separate stranger with whom she had been living as one flesh.
Was this what it all meant—utter, intact separateness, obscured by the heat of living? … Each time he
had taken her, they had been two isolated beings, far apart as now” (27). Elizabeth thus comes to

understand how little her knowledge of his body connected her with his mind. Indeed, her carnal
knowledge of him actually “obscured” their separateness, tricking her into trusting a false knowledge of
him. Elizabeth’s feeling of removal extends beyond her husband: she “felt the utter isolation of the
human soul, the child within her was a weight apart from her” (26). Chrystanthemums is thus a story
about our inability to penetrate beyond the outermost shell of others, even those we should be closest
to. We project onto their bodies images of drinking husbands or innocent children, but such images are
inevitably simplistic, a reflection primarily of the gulf of separation between people.
Such separation is not limited to Elizabeth’s relationship with her husband. The mother, for
instance, seems not to recognize either the man’s faults or the horror of his last moments: “He went
peaceful, Lizzie,‐‐peaceful as sleep” (27) she says of them. In contrast, the doctor says that he was “
‘Sphyxiated… It is the most terrible job I’ve ever known… Clean over him, an’ shut ‘im in, like a mouse‐
trap’” (23). Just as Elizabeth’s former understanding of her husband centered on his body, so too is the
mother’s perception tied to his physical appearance. “White as milk his, clear as a twelve‐month baby,
bless him, the darling!” she says, “Not a mark on him, clear and clean and white, beautiful as ever a child
was made… Isn’t he beautiful, the lamb?” (27). Yet, we know from Elizabeth’s memories that her
husband was quite capable of viciousness and drunkenness, traits that hardly suggest a “lamb.” The
mother is instead seeing the man as the child he once was or she imagines he once was. She is aided in
this illusion by the deceptions of his body. His pale skin is caused by his death,2 yet the mother views it
as a sign of innocence and purity. As was once true with Elizabeth, the mother uses the man’s body to
confirm a superficial conception of his mind.
The gulf between perception and reality is also apparent with The Trial’s K. and the numerous
characters he meets. For instance, when K. is called for an initial inquiry, he entirely misunderstands the
2 The skin or eyes of people who die from asphyxia are sometimes damaged from burst blood vessels, so it’s
possible the mother is deceiving herself on a more literal level. The narrator, though, describes the man as “of
handsome body, and his face showed no traces of drink” (26). Since no other disfigurement is noted, it seems that
the mother is probably not mistaken about his appearance.

nature of the proceedings. K. immediately focuses on the difference between the left and right halves of
the crowd. The right half generally seems to be supportive, applauding K. when he speaks (43) while the
left half remains silent. From this, K. somehow concludes that “The people in the party on the left, who
were in fact less numerous, may have been no more important than those in the party on the right, but
their calm demeanor made them appear more so. As K. now started to speak, he was convinced that he
was expressing their thoughts” (44‐45). Even early on, then, K.’s conclusions about the actors in this
situation seem strange. It is unclear, for instance, why K. should think that he was expressing the
thoughts of the silent party. As is often the case in The Trial, the description of the scene is mysteriously
elliptical in that we are presented with very few of the nuances which we would normally use to analyze
tone; all the information is presented in a matter‐of‐fact and analytical style. Notably, the narration
never addresses the oddity of such a stark division in a public courtroom. As another example, when the
magistrate asks K. whether he is a house painter, K.’s reply—that he is “the chief financial officer of a
large bank” (44)—provokes laughter from the right half of the hall. Yet, it is unclear what precisely is
funny. K., who joins in, clearly believes that they are laughing at the magistrate’s error. However, it
might just as well be that they are laughing at K.’s indignation or at the humiliating position of one so
socially powerful. Such questions cannot be answered in The Trial: the narration tells us nothing of K.’s
tone and only says of the laughter that it is “hearty” (44). Just as K. seems unable to understand others’
actions, often viewing them only as they relate to him, the experience of reading The Trial similarly
distances us from the characters through its factual tone. The inquiry scene concludes by overturning
K.’s assessment of the proceedings. After the washerwoman screams, K. realizes that “They all had
badges, as far as he could see. They were all one group, the apparent parties on the left and right” (52).
K. thus badly misreads the situation at his inquiry, evincing little understanding of any of the actors or
their purpose.

Flirtation and sex similarly distort K.’s assessment of people. When K. returns to the scene of the
inquiry, he once again meets the washerwoman who begins to flirt with him and offers to help him. K.
responds well to her grabbing his hand (56), but is repulsed by her complimenting his eyes, thinking “So
that’s all it is… she’s offering herself to me; she’s depraved, like everyone else around here… so she
accosts any stranger who comes along with a compliment about his eyes” (57‐58). He dismisses her,
saying “I don’t think you can help me” (58). However, after she seductively “[stretches] out her legs,
[and pulls] her dress up to her knee” (61), K.’s attitude changes. Suddenly, “The woman did tempt him,
and no matter how hard he thought about it, he could see no good reason not to give in to that
temptation. … And her offer of help sounded sincere, and was perhaps not without value” (62). Though
little about the nature of her offer has changed, K.’s view changes dramatically and he “easily brushed
away” “the fleeting objection that the woman was ensnaring him on the court’s behalf” (61). As with
Elizabeth, sex gives K. a false sense of knowing.
A counterargument to viewing K.’s interpretative ineptness as a personal failure would be to
argue that this failure stems from the complicated and paradoxical world in which K. resides. In this
view, the court system is an elaborate sham: K. never hears his charges, the magistrate mistakes him for
a house painter, and his lawyer never produces any tangible results in his defense. K.’s inability to
understand this system that ensnares him is not his own failing, then, but rather the result of the
maliciousness and opacity of the society he lives in.
While it is true that The Trial reflects many of the concerns with modern society, the
counterargument overlooks the personal nature of K.’s “trial.” Indeed, events relating to the trial
surreally pervade the most private spaces in K.’s life: his trial begins in his bedroom (3) and eventually
violates the safety and comfort of his workplace (80). Additionally, K. exhibits an internal
“bureaucratization” which is often the cause of his problems rather than the bureaucracy of the court
system. The first suggestion that K.’s issues are internal comes from the conversation with the inspector.

Of K.’s situation, the inspector says “you’ve misunderstood me; you’re under arrest, certainly, but that’s
not meant to keep you from carrying on your profession. Nor are you to be hindered in the course of
your ordinary life” (17). Rather than being locked up by a repressive government, K. is simply informed
that he is “under arrest”—that is, restricted or in stasis in some way. Yet, until the executioners come at
the end of the novel, no physical restrictions are ever placed on him. K.’s “arrest,” then, is of a mental
sort. Indeed, K. exhibits “arrested” thinking in a number of ways. First, his life is described as ordered
and static. In his desk, “everything lay in perfect order” (7) and his days are dominated by routine: “That
spring, K. generally spent his evenings as follows: after work, if there was still time… he would take a
short walk…. Then go to a tavern… In addition, K. paid a weekly visit to a woman named Elsa” (20).
Similarly, his thought processes reveal a bureaucratic thoroughness. When speaking to the magistrate,
for instance, he unnecessarily addresses technical objections to his statements, leaving them as
confusing and indirect as the proceedings against which he is protesting:
Your question, Your Honor, about my being a house painter—and you weren’t really asking at
all, you were telling me outright—is characteristic of the way these proceedings against me are
being conducted. You may object that these aren’t proceedings at all, and you’re certainly right
there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such. But I do recognize them, for the
moment, out of compassion, so to speak. One can only view them compassionately, if one
chooses to pay any attention to them at all. I’m not saying these proceedings are sloppy, but I
would like to propose that that description for your personal consideration. (45)
K.’s arrest is not manifested in the prison bars of a totalitarian state, but rather seems to be a comment
about K.’s state of mind. Like Kafka, K. is a bureaucrat, and The Trial is about his thinking rather than a
broken judicial system.
K.’s “bureaucratic” thinking leads to much of his aimlessness and failure to defend himself in his
trial. He is resistant to change, and throughout the novel searches for an easy way to acquit himself. This
desire is apparent in K.’s conversation with Titorelli. The painter describes how “there are three
possibilities: actual acquittal, apparent acquittal, and protraction” (152). The latter two involve constant
effort over time, and consequently K. prefers the first option, speaking of it “as if speaking to himself

and to his hopes” (154). Instead of seriously pursuing his defense, K. either does nothing or uselessly
pursues gimmicks he hopes will provide an easy resolution to his trial. When K.’s uncle comes to visit,
the uncle perceives that K. does not take his situation seriously: “And you sit there calmly with a criminal
trial hanging over your head?” the uncle exclaims (91). Even later on, K. still exercises little agency in his
defense. Though he believes “these efforts must be continuous, with everything organized and
supervised” (126), he finds “the difficulty of composing the petition was overwhelming. At one point,
about a week ago, it was only with a sense of shame that he could even contemplate having to prepare
such a petition some day; that it might be difficult had not even occurred to him” (126). K. understands
intellectually that vast efforts need to be put into his defense, yet he is pathetically ineffective at
motivating himself. When he is advised to consult the painter Titorelli, however, K. immediately goes to
see him, despite understanding that the hope for any real help is “vague… and slender” (139). K. thus
finds himself unequal to the task of his defense. Though he believes that “all he had to do now was turn
the abilities that had made [his rise in the bank] possible partially toward his trial” (125), he seems
unable to adapt those skills to a new task. Instead, he is paralyzed by its difficulty, able only to dither
about a relatively unimportant petition. K.’s trial is thus as much of an internal struggle as an external
one, and the strange bureaucracy which characterizes the trial is similarly a reflection of the
bureaucratic nature of K.’s own mind. As such, K.’s inability to understand the people he encounters
should be understood as a personal failing rather than the result of a sinister and manipulative society.
K.’s bureaucratic nature is undoubtedly influenced by modern society, but The Trial is a story about an
individual.
The ominous foreshadowing of Odour of Chystanthemums and the frequently atonal exposition
of The Trial both depict characters grappling with an inability to know others. Elizabeth Bates recognizes
that she “[had] been fighting a husband who did not exist” while “He existed all the time” (28). In other
words, her arguments had been with a projection of her husband, rather than the man himself whom

she did not see. She thus defined him primarily in relation to herself: a husband who left her for taverns
and came home ready to fight her. In a similar fashion, K. mostly sees people in terms of his trial. Most
of his sexual relationships, for instance, involve women who he believes can use their influence to free
him: “He, or the women, or some other messengers, would have to besiege the officials day after day
and force them to sit down at their desks” (126). When thinking of them here, K. does not even view
them as individuals, but simply as “the women.” Sex appeal plays into this trait, often distorting his
perceptions of these same women. Likewise, Elizabeth’s relations with her husband obscured the
distance between them: “If they met there, in the beyond, they would only be ashamed of what had
been before” (29). Despite significant differences in characters and tone, both texts thus seek to
illustrate the distance between people.
Though they face similar problems, Elizabeth and K.’s stories ultimately diverge. The death of
Elizabeth’s husband, indeed, provokes a new understanding of herself and him. This understanding can
be seen in the contrast between Elizabeth and her mother‐in‐law. At first, the narration connects the
two women in their common plight. As they wash him, “They worked… in silence for a long time. They
never forgot it was death, and the touch of the man’s dead body gave them strange emotions, different
in each of the women; a great dread possessed them both, the mother felt the lie given to her womb,
she was denied; the wife felt the utter isolation of the human soul, the child within her was a weight
apart from her” (26). Though they each experience “different” emotions, this passage emphasizes their
commonalities. Both share the “great dread,” and just as Elizabeth “was driven away” (25) so too is the
mother “denied.” The two also share in feeling the falsity of motherhood and in being disconnected
from their children. Moreover, by using plural pronouns, the passage portrays them as acting in unison
rather than separately. For a while, at least, the two women seem connected in their common grief.
However, Elizabeth, unlike her mother‐in‐law, possesses the courage and self‐awareness to face
her situation lucidly. The mother “[speaks] out of sheer terror… a faint, sibilant ecstasy of fear and

mother love” (26). The “ecstasy” of her speech implies a rapidity uninhibited by reflection. This lack of
reflection is significant, for, as noted earlier, the mother’s assessment of her son’s character and manner
of death is hardly discerning. Rather, she projects her conception of him as an innocent child onto his
adult self. Elizabeth, in contrast, reflects heavily on her husband and seems to come to a truer
understanding both of his character and of his end. The interspersion of passages relating her thoughts
with the mother’s rambling has the effect of distancing the two women while depicting Elizabeth’s
contemplativeness. For the next few pages (26‐29), the mother’s questions only briefly interrupt her
thoughts, illustrating her focus on the dead man. We are unable to hear what, if any, response Elizabeth
gives, which puts further distance between herself and the mother. The tone of these pages shows
Elizabeth to be subsumed in thought, removed from the more naïve comments made in the distance
above her consciousness.
Elizabeth, correspondingly, reaches starkly different conclusions about her husband than the
mother does. Whereas the mother holds on to her conception of the man as a child, Elizabeth realizes
that “she [Elizabeth] had been wrong. She had said he was something he was not; she had felt familiar
with him. Whereas he was apart all the while, living as she never lived, feeling as she never felt” (28).
While the mother reacts to the horror of the occasion by holding closer to her earlier views, Elizabeth
reacts by realizing their shallowness. By doing so, she comes to a fuller understanding of her husband as
a person not merely as a projection. Making such a realization is difficult, however. When she picks up
her husband’s body, “The horror of the distance between them was almost too much for her—it was so
infinite a gap she must look across” (30). Yet, she is able to look, and ends the story “with peace sunk
heavy on her heart… making tidy the kitchen” (30). After the spiritual agony of the night, she finds the
strength to return to the mundanity of daily life. The story’s final note is not one of empowerment—
“from death, her ultimate master, she wince[s] with fear and shame” (30)—but she is at last able to
breach the barriers between her husband and herself as well as those within herself.

K., in contrast, is unable to achieve a realization about himself or others, and is consequently
unable to defend himself in his trial, an inability that ultimately leads to his execution. K. exhibits his lack
of personal growth when discussing the parable with the chaplain. As soon as the chaplain finishes, the
two men have the following exchange:
‘So the doorkeeper deceived the man,’ said K. at once, strongly attracted to the story. ‘Don’t be
too hasty,’ said the priest, ‘don’t accept another person’s opinion unthinkingly. I told you the
story word for word according to the text. It says nothing about deception… He wasn’t asked
earlier… and remember he was only a doorkeeper and as such fulfilled his duty’ (217).
Even at the end of the novel, K. is unable to attribute blame to the man in the parable, and, by analogy,
to himself. He much prefers the explanation of a simple deception to a nuanced interpretation. The
chaplain, in vain, attempts to remind him that the parable, and by analogy life, does not offer
straightforward answers to the questions it raises. As noted earlier, K. generally looks for easy solutions
to his problems, and arguing for an easy moral acquittal of the parable’s protagonist shows he has
learned little from the experience of his trial. Consequently, when the men come to execute him, he at
first resists, but ultimately leads them: “Now all three of them, in total accord, crossed a bridge in the
moonlight, the men yielding willingly to K.’s slightest move” (228). Though his executioners seem to be
an instrument of outside repression, K. becomes complicit and even seems to take control over their
direction. This scene is thus, in a sense, a microcosm for the whole story’s trajectory. K.’s trial likewise
seems to be an unjust imposition from outside, but K.’s apathy toward his defense is ultimately
responsible for his execution. Indeed, it is natural for us to face “trials” which are unjust and
unaccommodating of individual circumstances. It is expected of us to handle such trials with decisive
maturity, onerous though they may be. As with his response to the parable, this fact seems to be lost on
K. Indeed, he much prefers to think of the “legal system” as invalid, publicly calling the room of the
magistrate’s hearing a “so‐called court” (49). While this opinion is legitimate, it shows that K. does not
have the courage to take seriously the unfair proceedings against him. Unlike Elizabeth, he lacks the

strength to look across that “infinite gap” and appreciate the world as a complex and often irrational
place.
Odour of Chrystanthemums and The Trial begin with the same struggle to understand others,
but end in different places. On the one hand, Elizabeth is able to escape her limitations and achieve a
true moment of empathy with her husband. K., on the other, dies too weak to even give himself an
honorable death. As his executioners pass the knife back and forth,
K. knew clearly now that it was his duty to seize the knife as it floated from hand to hand above
him and plunge it into himself. But he didn’t do so… He could not rise entirely to the occasion,
he could not relieve the authorities of all their work; the responsibility for this final failure lay
with whoever had denied him the remnant of strength necessary to do so (230).
To the end, then, K. lacks the strength to handle his situation as he knows he should. Though this
“failure” is a personal one, K. persists in blaming outside forces for it. While it is possible his initial
struggle with the guards wore him out, his attribution of blame is decidedly vague, implying that he has
no plausible culprit in mind. As such, K.’s accusation is merely a final refusal to accept responsibility for
his actions. The flaws of K.’s character throughout the novel are also present at his execution. Just
before he is killed, he sees a blurry figure reaching out and wonders “Who was it? A friend? A good
person? Someone who cared? Someone who wanted to help? Was it just one person? Was it everyone?
Was there still help? Were there objections that had been forgotten? Of course there were. Logic is no
doubt unshakable, but it can’t withstand a person who wants to live” (230‐31). As before, K. hopes for
an easy solution in the form of a rescuer, yet that hope is hardly realistic. He is further focused on the
unfairness of the situation, believing that there are still “objections” to be made. K. then dies, and “the
verdict” is given as “‘Like a dog’ … it seemed as though the shame was to outlive him” (231). He dies
shamefully—“like a dog”—reinforcing the notion of his failure. K. never learns to understand the people
or society around him, unjust as it may be, and his story is thus a tragedy of a static character.
The stories’ divergence corresponds to the texts’ differing tones and styles. The often
impersonal and atonal nature of The Trial limits the potential for character development. While

characters need not be developed explicitly, The Trial is generally not concerned with an exposition of
K.’s character. For instance, when K. attempts to bribe the flogger, it is unclear why he does so. On the
one hand, he seems motivated by vaguely moral reasons as “It tormented him that he had been unable
to prevent the flogging” (85). Yet, these reasons are immediately qualified by “but it wasn’t his fault; if
Franz hadn’t screamed—of course it must have hurt terribly, but at critical moments you have to control
yourself” (85). K. is thus hardly an empathetic person, adding more questions as to the nature of his
character. This small, elliptical passage is the only indication The Trial gives as to K.’s motivations for the
attempted bribe and no similar incident occurs later in the text. We are thus left with only this isolated
incident to speculate about a large aspect of K.’s character. The flogging thus shows K. to be something
of a moral man, but we have little idea to what extent; does K. excuse himself so easily because his
morals are not strong? Or is he a man of average moral fiber, but one who has trouble accepting blame?
These are questions The Trial does not allow us to answer fully. Of course, such ellipticism is justified in
many cases and can often be more evocative than a fully fleshed out description. However, this passage
is typical rather than exceptional for The Trial, leaving many aspects of K.’s character as sketches instead
of those of a full human being.
The Trial, while being the story about an individual, is not the story of an individual. Some
aspects of K.’s personality, such as his propensity to procrastinate, are developed throughout the story.
Yet, the omission of other aspects renders K. something of an abstraction. Indeed, we are never even
given a physical description of K. Such abstraction is not inconsistent with The Trial’s imagery and
themes. For instance, as a novel about modern people, K.’s abstraction allows The Trial to have general
implications; instead of focusing on K. as a person, the focus is on K.’s traits that are relevant to modern
people. However, abstraction does impose some limits on The Trial’s focus. Namely, it limits the
prospects for character change as such transformations are complemented by fully developed
characters. The Trial’s specific themes also discourage transformations. The Trial is about modern

bureaucracy and a “bureaucratic” man, but bureaucracies are characteristically static. As such, it would
be difficult to imagine The Trial as the story of a man who, at the outset, is constrained in his
understanding of others, but ultimately overcomes this difficulty. Not only would this story require the
new K. to radically change his fundamentally bureaucratic nature, but it would require a new focus on
K.’s individuality. That focus, however, would run counter to the elliptical and impersonal tone set by
The Trial, a tone at the very heart of its statement about the modern world.
In contrast, Chrysanthemums is the story of an individual with the modern world as a backdrop.
As represented by the image of the locomotive and the colt from the outset (1), the technology of
modern society seems to ominously encroach upon nature and human lives. Indeed Elizabeth’s life, like
K.’s, is a product of the modern world. The “locomotive engine, Number 4, came clanking, stumbling
down from Selston… The trucks thumped heavily past, one by one, with slow inevitable movement, as
she [Elizabeth] stood insignificantly trapped between the jolting black wagons and the hedge” (1). The
imagery of the story’s beginning, then, portrays modern technology as an enclosing and stultifying force,
and perhaps an isolating one as well. Elizabeth’s temporary entrapment foreshadows her husband’s in
the coal mine, the mine itself being another product of modern technology. Indeed, part of what
separates Elizabeth from her husband is his coal miner’s lifestyle: he toils away underground and, for
relief, turns to drink before turning to her. From the outset, technology is marked by dark colors, and
many of the hues of Chrysanthemums also mark it was a dark story. The locomotive and its smoke are
black; the coal mine is in the darkness of the earth’s depths and the coal itself is black or dark blue;
Elizabeth has “definite black eyebrows” (2), “smooth black hair” (2), and wears a “big black bonnet”
(26). The forces of the modern world are thus quite present in Chrysanthemums and unnaturally trap or
separate characters. However, Chrysanthemums is first and last a story about a woman who, in losing
her husband, begins to understand him. Unlike The Trial, Chrysanthemums gives us an in‐depth look into
the mind of an individual. The narration vividly depicts Elizabeth’s emotions with phrases such as “in her

womb was an ice of fear” (27) or “She drank her tea determinedly, and sat thinking. When she rose her
anger was evident in the stern unbending of her head” (8). The forces of the modern world are thus
merely the setting rather than the focus of the story. The relationship between Elizabeth and her
husband, for instance, is developed and full of idiosyncratic detail. Moreover, unlike K., Elizabeth
possesses many traits which do not stem from being a product of the modern world. For instance, a
substantial section of the story depicts her growing dread when her husband does not return home, a
dread which grows despite the estrangement of their marriage. In this light, it is unsurprising that
Elizabeth undergoes such a stark transformation in Chrysanthemums. Not only do the details of her
character give the text a greater latitude to depict her changing, but the transformation is consistent
with Chrysanthemum’s focus on Elizabeth as an individual.
The fates of the texts’ protagonists ultimately stem from the tone each text establishes at the
outset. The Trial opens with the line “Someone must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without
having done anything truly wrong, he was arrested” (3). From the outset, then, the narration blames
external forces, yet the word “truly” implies that the statement is more protest than fact. Further, we
can already see the ellipticism and ambiguity of the narration: we will never find out what exactly K. did
or did not do that was “wrong.” What is important for The Trial’s purposes are not the details of its
protagonist’s life or past, but the abstract notions of the “arrest” and “wrongness.” The Trial thus
explores these themes in the context of the modern world’s bureaucracy and devotes less attention to
K. as an individual. As a consequence, he is left on an unalterable trajectory to his death. In
Chrysanthemums, so too do the opening lines set the tone for the rest of the story. Just as the colt in can
temporarily “outdistance” (1) the train, so too is Elizabeth’s outdistancing of death’s coldness
temporary, as the text’s last line suggests. Elizabeth’s revelation is meaningful, but it is ultimately
private; she communicates nothing of her understanding to the mother, and, indeed, “strove to weep
and behave as her mother‐in‐law expected” (29). In this sense, her revelations are temporary as they

will end with her, and little will change outwardly because of them. Yet, the colt’s athletic vibrancy
suggests that there is still room for nature and individuality in spite of the “inevitability” of the train.
This freedom philosophically grants her the ability to delay the “shame” of death, instead allowing her
to renew her focus on life. The two texts, then, represent different approaches to the same fundamental
difficulty of human relations; complexity and nuance are at the heart of our natures, yet those very
features make truly knowing another an ever elusive end.

Suetonius, 72:
• He lived at first near the Forum Romanium, above
the Stairs of the Ringmakers, in a house which had

Hortensius, which was remarkable neither for size
nor elegance, having but short colonnades with

Suetonius, 22
He built out a part of the palace right into the Forum, and
making the Temple of Castor and Pollux its vestibule, he
often took his place between the divine brethren, and
exhibited himself there to be worshipped by those who
presented themselves; and some hailed him as Jupiter
Latiaris.
…he would talk confidentially with Jupiter Capitolinus, now
whispering and then in turn his ear to the mouth of the god,
now in louder and even angry language…But finally won by
entreaties, as he reported, and even invited to live with the
god, he built a bridge over the temple to the Deified
Augustus, and thus joined his Palace to the Capitol.
Presently, to be nearer yet, he laid the foundations of a new
house in the court of the Capitol.

There was nothing however in which he was more
ruinously prodigal than in building. He made a palace
extending all the way from the Palatine to the Esquiline,
which at first he called the House of Passage, but when it
was burned shortly after its completion and rebuilt, the
Golden House.
It’s size and splendour will be sufficiently indicated by the
following details. Its vestibule was large enough to contain a
colossal statue of the emperor a hundred and twenty feet
high; and it was so extensive that it had a triple colonnade a
mile long. There was a pond too, like a sea, surrounded with
buildings to represent cities.

Besides tracts of country, varied by tilled fields,

pearl. There were dining-rooms with fretted ceils of ivory,
whose panels could turn and shower down flowers and were
fitted with pipes for sprinkling the guests with perfumes. The
main banquet hall was circular and constantly revolved day
and night, like the heavens. He had baths supplied with sea
water and sulphur water.
When the edifice was finished in this style and he
dedicated it, he deigned to say nothing more in the way of
approval than that he was at last beginning to be housed
like a human being.

Natural History
Pliny, 34.84
The most famous of the art works in Rome that
I have mentioned above were originally brought
to Rome by Nero’s looting and placed around
the private rooms of the Domus Aurea, but
were since dedicated by the emperor
Vespasian to the Temple of Peace and his
other buildings.

The Jewish War
Josephus, 7.158
After his triumph was finished [in AD 71] and Roman rule
was re-established on a firm foundation, Vespasian
decided to build a Temple of Peace. The complex was
completed very quickly, and in a style that beggars the
imagination.
Not only did he have enormous financial resources
at his disposal; but he embellished it with old masterpieces
of painting and sculpture. In fact, into that one sacred
precinct were gathered and stationed all the art-works that
people had been willing to travel the world over to see,
even when they were scattered. Vespasian also proudly
kept here the works of gold taken from the Temple of the
Jews.

Vespasian
Suetonius, 9
He also undertook new works, the temple
of Peace hard by the Forum and one to the
Deified Claudius on the Caelian Mount, which
was begun by Agrippina, but almost utterly
destroyed by Nero; also an amphitheatre in the
heart of the city, a plan which he learned that
Augustus had cherished.

Martial on the Colosseum
Where the starry Colossus sees the constellations at close
range and lofty scaffolding rises in the middle of the road,
once gleamed the odious halls of a cruel monarch, and in
all Rome there stood a single house. Where rises before
our eyes the august pile of the Amphitheatre, was once
Nero’s lake. Where we admire the warm baths, a speedy
gift, a haughty tract of land had robbed the poor of their
dwellings. Where the Claudian colonnade unfolds its
wide-spread shade, was the outermost part of the palace’s
end. Rome has been restored to herself, and under your
rule, Caesar, the pleasances that belonged to a master
now belong to the people.

‘Q. Lutatius Catulus speaking against the law (to
confer the command against the pirates on Cn.
Pompeius) said in an informal harangue that
Pompeius was certainly an outstanding man, but
that he was too eminent for comfort in a free
republic and that all power should not be placed
in the hands of one man’
