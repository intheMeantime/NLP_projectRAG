      "To determine the number of positive real zeros of the given function $f(x) = x^5 + 4x^4 - 3x^2 + x - 6$, we can apply Descartes' Rule of Signs.\n",

      "1. Count the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the function: There are 3 sign changes (from positive to negative or negative to positive).\n",
      "2. The maximum number of positive real zeros is the number of sign changes, which is 3.\n",
      "3. To find the actual number of positive real zeros, we can analyze the function's behavior as $x$ approaches 0 and as $x$ approaches infinity.\n",
      "4. As $x$ approaches 0, the function $f(x)$ approaches negative infinity.\n",
      "5. As $x$ approaches infinity, the function $f(x)$ approaches positive infinity.\n",
