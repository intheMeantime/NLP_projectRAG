The context provided does not contain any information about the variables X_1, X_2, ... or the convergence in distribution to a normal distribution.\\n2. To find the values of a and b, we need to apply the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will approximate a normal distribution.\\n3. For the given variables X_k, each taking values +1 or -1 with equal probabilities, the expected value (a) is E[X_k] = (1 + (-1))/2 = 0.\\n4. The variance (b) can be calculated as Var[X_k] = E[(X_k - E[X_k])^2] = E[X_k^2] - (E[X_k])^2 = 1 - 0 = 1.\\n5. Therefore, the values of a and b are 0 and 1, respectively.\\n\\nSo, the answer is [0, 1].\",\n",

      "1. The context provided does not contain any information about the variables X_1, X_2, ... or the convergence in distribution to a normal distribution.\n",
      "2. To find the values of a and b, we need to apply the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will approximate a normal distribution.\n",
      "3. For the given variables X_k, each taking values +1 or -1 with equal probabilities, the expected value (a) is E[X_k] = (1 + (-1))/2 = 0.\n",
      "4. The variance (b) can be calculated as Var[X_k] = E[(X_k - E[X_k])^2] = E[X_k^2] - (E[X_k])^2 = 1 - 0 = 1.\n",
      "5. Therefore, the values of a and b are 0 and 1, respectively.\n",
